[1]              
The Applicant seeks numerous orders for disclosure, non-dissipation, and
costs.
[2]              
The parties were married in 2018 and separated in 2022.  There is one
child of the marriage who is three years old.
[3]              
I could not locate the Applicant’s pleadings on Case Center.  The
Respondent’s Answer was filed in May 2023.
[4]              
The parties confirmed that leave for questioning was granted in April
2024.  Neither pursued it.
[5]              
At a trial management conference in September 2024, an issue arose
around disclosure (the Applicant deposes that disclosure has been a continuing
challenge).  The conference judge, Des Rosiers J., granted leave for a regular,
one-hour motion to address it.
[6]              
Neither party prepared a factum.  They did file sworn affidavits and
numerous exhibits.
[7]              
This case is primarily about disclosure.  I take notice of the following
principles stated in Howes v. Ciolfi, 2022 ONSC 3076 (CanLII):
[8]              
The Applicant deposes that she believes the Respondent has “falsified
documents in an attempt to intentionally deplete assets”.  She alleges
emotional, physical and financial abuse.
[9]              
The Applicant argues that as financial disclosure was exchanged, “questions
arose regarding a total sum of $363,000.00” the Respondent withdrew from the
parties’ joint Home Equity Line of Credit (“HELOC”) without her consent.   She
raised particular concern with:
[10]          
When questioned about these amounts, the Applicant deposes, the
Respondent claimed that “the funds were used to repay loans borrowed when
purchasing the matrimonial home and has presented two alleged promissory notes
that [the Applicant] had never seen before”.
[11]          
In her Notice of Motion, the Applicant made four disclosure requests:
[12]          
In her reply Affidavit, the Applicant requested numerous additional
items because, she says, the Respondent’s disclosure to date raised more
questions than provided answers.
[13]          
I find that the Applicant’s additional requests in her reply affidavit
approach the kind of “outmost disclosure” the Court cautions against in Howes,
supra.  On a short motion, it was simply not possible to determine the
relevance and proportionality of these additional requests.  Consequently, I
will confine myself to the Applicant’s original requests.
[14]          
The Applicant deposes that, in order to determine the validity of the
alleged promissory notes, she requires the original documents be submitted for
“chemical ink testing” to determine their date of execution.
[15]          
Applicant’s counsel acknowledged that her motion materials do not fully
explain how she intends to test the notes including (a) the process for
selecting and retaining the expert (b) the process for that testing including
its impact, if any, on the documents’ integrity and (c) the timeline.
[16]          
At the hearing, Respondent’s counsel confirmed that they do not object
to such testing provided it occurs under a suitable plan.
[17]          
Counsel for both parties agree that this request shall be adjourned sine
die to permit them to determine a suitable process without the need for judicial
intervention.  The Court commends their willingness to cooperate.
[18]          
The Applicant requests virtual tracing of the electronically signed
documents, including but not limited to:
[19]          
The Respondent deposes that:
[20]          
The Applicant argues that there “must be” some electronic document
attending the original Dhaliwal note.  The Respondent says that the only such
document was created to respond to the disclosure request.  Because the
Applicant’s allegation is speculative, there is no evidence before the Court that
counters the Respondent’s statement.
[21]          
With respect to the Grover note, the Court has no evidence regarding how
document-signing occurs on WhatsApp, and whether the Applicant’s request can be
satisfied. However, the Applicant does not have sufficient evidence to rebut
the Respondent’s claim that he cannot satisfy this request.
[22]          
The Respondent has, in effect, replied to the virtual tracing request by
saying that what the Applicant wants is impossible.
[23]          
The Respondent advises that both Mr. Dhaliwal and Mr. Grover are listed
as witnesses for trial.
[24]          
I find that additional orders regarding virtual tracing are not warranted. 
This issue will be suitably addressed at trial where the Applicant can fully
test the Respondent’s narrative for credibility, reliability and plausibility.
[25]          
The Applicant’s request is dismissed.
[26]          
The Applicant demands proof of interest payments made during the
promissory notes’ respective terms.
[27]          
The Respondent deposes that interest payments were not paid separately. 
Instead:
[28]          
The Applicant says that the Respondent’s provided figures do not add
up.  The Respondent counters that this is not a matter of disclosure, but a
substantive issue for trial.  I agree.
[29]          
Again, I am persuaded that the Respondent has responded to the request
for disclosure, albeit not to the Applicant’s satisfaction.
[30]          
The Applicant’s request is dismissed.
[31]          
The Applicant asks for “a full tracing of funds used to ‘repay’ the
Lenders of the promissory notes”.
[32]          
In his affidavit, the Respondent deposes to a number of facts, with
attached documents, about how the original funds were loaned, their deposit
into the parties’ HELOC account, the Respondent’s Scotiabank incoming transfer
deposits, and redacted bank statements from both Mr. Dhaliwal and Mr. Grover.
[33]          
On a one-hour motion limited to a paper record, the court is unable to
ascertain the validity or reliability of any of these documents.
[34]          
Therefore, I am persuaded that the Respondent has provided what he
says is a tracing of the funds.  This is now clearly an issue for trial
where the Applicant can follow up on the Respondent’s narrative and accompanying
exhibits.
[35]          
This request is likewise dismissed.
[36]          
The Applicant seeks an order “restraining the Respondent Husband from
depleting or dissipating any property under his control and requiring the
Respondent Husband to preserve all such property in which he has a direct or
indirect interest, whether such interest is legal or beneficial, or any other
interest, including but not limited to bank accounts, investments, shares, real
property and business interests, pending further Court Order or written
agreement by the parties authorizing the distribution of same.”
[37]          
Justice Des Rosiers granted the Applicant leave to bring a motion for
disclosure.  Her Honour’s endorsement did not mention any other relief.  It is
unclear whether this issue was otherwise conferenced.
[38]          
Rule 14(4) of the Family Law Rules allows the court to address an issue
that has not been previously conferenced if the court “is of the opinion
that there is a situation of urgency of hardship...or some other reason in the
interests of justice.”  The Applicant’s affidavit filed for this motion makes a
single reference to the Respondent’s intent to deplete his assets.   The
Applicant does not outline the legal test for dissipation or show how the facts
support that test.
[39]          
I find that the Applicant’s request for a non-depletion/dissipation
order against all of the Respondent’s property is (a) outside the leave granted
for this motion and (b) not demonstrably urgent.  The request is dismissed
without prejudice.
[40]          
While the Applicant has not prevailed on this motion, I do not find that
she was unreasonable in bringing it.  I am persuaded that disclosure has been
piecemeal necessitating the Applicant to “chase down” information. For example,
a short time before this motion the Respondent supplied information that would
have been available to him previously. In the circumstances, the parties shall bear
their own costs.
[41]          
In conclusion, I make the following order:
