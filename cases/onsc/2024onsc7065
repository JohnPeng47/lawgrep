[1]            The parties had a dispute over whether the Defendant was liable for the improper manufacturing of windows that were installed in the Plaintiff’s building back in 2014.  The claim was advanced in tort, contract and warranty, and was litigated over twelve days late last year and early this year.  The Plaintiff’s claims were in excess of $2 million.
[2]           In reasons released October 1st, 2024, I dismissed all of the Plaintiff’s claims except for approximately $15,000 in claims under the warranty.  I invited costs submissions if the parties were unable to agree on the costs of the action.  The parties provided those submissions but as will be seen, I had to follow up on points I had specifically raised in my trial judgment that the parties originally did not comment upon.
[3]           There are some elements of both my decision and of the trial itself that require some elaboration before I outline my disposition of the costs issues.
[4]           This was a virtual trial conducted as part of the Southwest Region’s virtual trial blitz in November of 2023.  The goal of this blitz was to attempt to reduce the backlog of cases in the Region that had built up as a result of various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result, matters were selected for this blitz based in large part on whether they were ready for trial and were amenable to a ZOOM trial.
[5]           It is well-known that ZOOM trials come with their own unique challenges.  Those challenges include the fact that the Court must manage all of the documents electronically.  This case had significant issues in terms of the documents and other items (including a full-sized window) that the parties sought to enter into evidence.  Marking the full-sized window as an exhibit over ZOOM presented some challenges, but those were not insurmountable.
[6]           Some of the other problems with the evidentiary record are described at paragraphs 59 to 63 of my reasons.  The problems that I identified in my reasons included the failure to agree on a joint book of documents and the failure to hyperlink the documents that each side filed on CaseLines.  As a result, I adjourned the trial for a day in order to provide the parties with an opportunity to come to an agreement on the documents that should be admitted as well as the basis for the admission of those documents.  At the outset of trial and prior to adjourning it, I directed the parties’ attention to the Court of Appeal’s decision in Girao v Cunningham 2020 ONCA 260.  Neither counsel seemed familiar with that decision.
[7]           In any event, the parties were unable to agree on a joint book of documents, or even on which documents were admissible, at the outset of the trial.  As a result, each side filed their own books of documents.  Neither book of documents was particularly helpful.
[8]           The Plaintiff’s book of documents, which was a single item uploaded to CaseLines, contained no hyperlinks when it was viewed on CaseLines.  It is possible that there were hyperlinks in the document, but the document was so large (more than a gigabyte) that every time I tried to download it, my computer crashed.
[9]           The Defendant’s documents were somewhat easier to navigate through, as they were divided into several volumes.  However, the Defendant’s CaseLines versions of their document books also did not include any hyperlinks and I could not seem to find any links to specific documents when I downloaded them either.
[10]        This brings me to the overlap between the two sets of documents.  To give a sense of the scope of the duplication between the parties’ books of documents, the following documents all appeared at least twice in the materials that were filed at trial:
[11]        In short, the duplication was significant.  It meant that several hundred pages of documents without hyperlinks were duplicated as between the two sets of documents.
[12]        To make matters more difficult, counsel used different page references to refer to the same documents when they were leading witnesses through evidence.  For example, Plaintiff’s counsel would refer to the contract in her book of documents and provide the page reference for it.  The Defendant’s counsel would then refer to the contract in his book of documents and provide a different page reference for it.  There were occasions where witnesses were referred to different copies of the same document depending on whether they were in examination in chief or cross-examination.
[13]        The astute observer will have noted that, in the previous paragraph, I did not use the phrase “CaseLines page reference”.  That is because Plaintiff’s counsel (not the counsel making these submissions) did not use CaseLines page references when she was referring witnesses to evidence.  Instead, she used the page references from the PDF that she had filed.  As a result, on each occasion that Plaintiff’s counsel referred to a document, I was required to provide the CaseLines page reference for the Court record.  It was much like what I imagine conducting a group reading of a novel from two different editions of the same book would be like.  Chaotic, somewhat confusing and frustrating for the participants.
[14]        Ultimately, I directed the parties to prepare written submissions.  As part of my directions for these submissions, I required the parties to refer to the CaseLines page numbers for documents.  They did that, but they continued to refer to different versions of the same documents.
[15]        At the conclusion of the evidence, I provided the parties with a series of questions.  Those included directions requiring the parties to consider the Court of Appeal’s decision in Cunningham.  Specifically, the parties were to advise me as to whether all copies of the documents were acknowledged to be true copies of the documents, whether any documents that had been challenged had been authenticated and whether I should treat all of the e-mails and other documents in the exhibits as having been proven.  The parties confirmed their answers to these questions, but not until final written submissions had been received.
[16]        I released my reasons in this matter on October 1st, 2024.  That decision found that there were approximately ten (10) windows that had problems that should be covered by the Defendant’s warranty and directed the payment of $15,000. to replace these windows.  The Plaintiff’s claims were otherwise dismissed.
[17]        In my reasons for judgment, I directed the parties to specifically address the issues that this case had with documents.  Paragraphs 59 to 61 of my reasons state:
[18]        I received the parties’ first round of submissions prior to October 20th, 2024.  Neither party had addressed, in any meaningful way, my observations and directions in paragraphs 59 to 61 of the decision on the merits.  As a result, I provided the parties with further directions on October 20th, 2024.  Those directions invited each party to provide submissions specifically on paragraphs 59 to 61 of my judgment.
[19]        The parties duly provided additional submissions on these paragraphs.  I will now turn to the positions of the parties.
[20]        The Plaintiff argues that it should be entitled to its partial indemnity costs in the sum of $119,059.06 inclusive of HST and disbursements.  The Plaintiff argues that they were successful in proving that the warranty had been breached.  Although the Plaintiff’s recovery was much more modest than the amount that they had sought in its’ claim, the Defendant refused to honour the warranty.  The Plaintiff argues that, while proportionality is an applicable principle, it is of limited assistance in this case because of the Defendant’s refusal to honour the warranty.
[21]        The Plaintiff also argues that the costs that they incurred were reasonable given both the nature of the work that had to be done and the length of time that the trial took.  Finally, in respect of the documents issues, the Plaintiff argues that the appropriate approach is for the Court to reduce the costs by twelve hours, which is the amount of in-Court time that was specifically spent on document management issues.  This reduces the Plaintiff’s costs claim by just over $4,000 to $115,000.00 all inclusive.
[22]        The Defendant seeks costs on a partial indemnity basis in the sum of $178,902.93, inclusive of HST and disbursements.  The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff was unsuccessful in most of the issues that it advanced.  For example, the claim under the Sale of Goods Act, the claim of negligence, the claim for pure economic loss and the claim for general damages were all dismissed.  The Defendant also argues that the Plaintiff’s claims of more than $2.5 million need to be compared to the damages that the Plaintiff was actually awarded.  That amount was a much more modest $15,000.00.  As a result, the Defendant argues that it was successful and that it should be entitled to its partial indemnity costs.
[23]        In response to my concerns about the documents in this case, the Defendant takes the position that the time spent in Court on November 14th and 15th, 2023 should be removed from the bill of costs as the failure of the parties to agree on the documentation “essentially wasted the court’s time and resource for the whole of November 14 and one-half of November 15, 2023.”
[24]        Each party also provided reply submissions.  Those submissions set out various grounds for challenging the positions taken by each side in their original costs submissions.
[25]        Based on the positions of the parties, there are two main issues that I have to resolve, as follows:
[26]        I will deal with each issue in turn.
[27]        Counsel for the Plaintiff argues that the Plaintiff was successful because they obtained a declaration in respect of the warranty which was, somehow, significant.  Counsel for the Defendant argues that the Defendant was successful because they were successful in resisting most of the Plaintiff’s legal claims, and virtually all of the Plaintiff’s monetary claims.
[28]        In order to understand who was successful, it is useful to consider the discussion in Scipione v. Scipione 2015 ONSC 5982.  In that decision, the Court stated (at paragraphs 1-7):
[29]        While Scipione is a family law case, the discussion of how to define success applies beyond family law.  It also applies in cases such as this.  In my view, the Defendant was the successful party.  I will now explain why I reached that conclusion.
[30]        First, there is the argument that the Plaintiff obtained “significant” relief with my decision that the warranty applied to a few of the windows.  The Plaintiff is correct that there was very little communication between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the year before the litigation started.  However, it must also be remembered that all of the Plaintiff’s correspondence in this time period was focused on obtaining compensation for the condensation issues.  In addition, the Defendant had previously addressed warranty claims, so there was no real dispute that the warranty was valid and could be claimed against.  Finally, while I allowed some warranty claims, the warranty did not cover the condensation issues that were the Plaintiff’s focus.
[31]        Beyond the warranty issue, the Plaintiff advanced a series of other claims in both contract and negligence.  In light of all of these claims, it must be remembered what the Plaintiff was asking for.  They were seeking to have the Defendant pay for the entire replacement costs of the windows for the Plaintiff’s building, which was a sum of over $2 million.  The Plaintiff was also seeking general damages in the sum of $500,000.  The basis for the general damages claim was never made clear to me (see paragraph 173 of the merits decision).
[32]        It is difficult to say that the Plaintiff was substantially successful when they had a $2.5 million claim and ended up being given damages of $15,000, especially when this very modest damage award was based on only one part of the claim.  The rest of the Plaintiff’s claims were dismissed.
[33]        This brings me to the decisions that the Plaintiff relied upon in order to argue that it had been successful and/or that it should be entitled to costs.  First, there is the decision in A and A Steelseal Waterproofing Inc. v. Kalovski, 2010 ONSC 2652.  In that decision, the facts are different from what we have here.  In Kalovski, the Plaintiff had been prepared to forego the entire claim when it was dismissed for delay.  It was the Defendant who had resurrected the claim and insisted on pursuing a substantial counterclaim.  The counterclaim was dismissed at trial, and the trial judge determined that the Plaintiff should have its costs.
[34]        This case is different.  The only offers that the Plaintiff made that I am aware of are as follows:
[35]        These two offers would both have required the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff a total in excess of $1 million.  Given the fact that the value of the Defendant’s original contract was approximately $300,000.00, it is understandable as to why neither of these offers were particularly attractive to the Defendant.
[36]        This brings me to the next case that the Plaintiff relied on, Prasher Steel Ltd. v. BWK Construction Company Ltd. and Peel District School Board, 2023 ONSC 3494.  In that decision, McGee J. stated (at para. 14) “[a] failure to make an offer to settle is unreasonable litigation conduct.”  I generally agree with that observation, although it is not always applicable, as I will discuss below.
[37]        However, in this case, there are two reasons why Prasher does not assist the Plaintiffs.  First, the Plaintiff’s offers (as described at paragraph 34) were unreasonable enough that they do not really amount to offers to settle either.  Put simply, offering to settle a negligence/contract claim for three times the amount you paid the other party is, absent special circumstances, an unreasonable offer.  Second, the Defendant eventually made an offer to settle.  That offer, made after the trial started, was for $100,000 all inclusive.  Given the outcome of the trial (and the outcome of this costs decision), that offer was more than reasonable.
[38]        The Plaintiff also relies on a series of other decisions.  A review of one of them will demonstrate why these decisions do not support the Plaintiff’s position.  In Persampieri v. Hobbs, 2018 ONSC 368, the Court was considering the Plaintiff’s claim after a motor vehicle accident.  The parties had reached an agreement that liability would be admitted in exchange for the damages claim being limited to the policy limits in the insurance policy.  However, the Defendants were not prepared to admit that the Plaintiff had suffered any damages as a result of the accident, and a trial was required.
[39]        Ms. Persampieri succeeded in obtaining damages from the jury that amounted to just over $20,000.00 after the deductibles under the Insurance Act had been applied to the jury’s actual award, which was considerably higher.  The Court found that the Plaintiff should be entitled to costs, as she had been successful, and that those costs should not be limited by the principle of proportionality.
[40]        This case is different from Persamperi.  In Persamperi, the Plaintiff was successful on the only real issue: whether she had suffered damages as a result of the car accident.  In this case, the Plaintiff advanced claims that the condensation on the inside of the windows was caused by the Defendant’s negligence, as well as a very substantial claim for economic damages.  Those claims, which had to be (and were) vigorously defended, were all resolved in the Defendant’s favour.  Persampieri is distinguishable from the case before me, as are the other decisions that Plaintiff’s counsel provided me with.
[41]        Defendant’s counsel points me to the decision in Bell Canada v. Olympia & York Development Ltd., 1994 CanLII 239 (ON CA), (1994) 17 O.R. (3d) 135.  In that decision, the Court was considering a multi-million dollar claim that Bell Canada had made against O & Y.  O & Y made no offers to settle the action beforehand.  During the middle of the trial, O & Y offered to settle the claim for $2 million.  Bell Canada recovered only $25,000 at trial.  The Court noted that this was “non-recovery in any meaningful sense.”
[42]        The trial judge declined to order any costs to Bell Canada, as the modest recovery was non-recovery in any meaningful sense.  However, the trial judge also declined to order any costs in O & Y’s favour, in large part because O & Y had not made any offers to settle until after the trial had been going on for two years. The Court of Appeal overturned this decision, stating:
[43]        In my view, this passage applies to the case before me.  The Defendants were faced with a very large claim and had good reasons to resist that claim.  The very modest recovery on one issue does not assist the Plaintiffs in either establishing an entitlement to costs or in resisting the Defendant’s entitlement to costs as the successful party.
[44]        In the end, the Defendant was almost entirely successful in this case and should be entitled to their costs on a partial indemnity basis.  However, the Plaintiff had a very modest success on one small issue.  It should also be remembered that the Plaintiff’s success on the warranty issue was not complete.  This success should entitle the Plaintiff to a very modest deduction in the total costs that were payable.  With that in mind, I now turn to the other factors under Rule 57.01.
[45]        Usually, the most important factor under Rule 57.01 is the idea that the successful litigant should be entitled to their costs on a partial indemnity basis.  I have already addressed that factor above.  Of the other factors set out under Rule 57.01, the following are the most relevant to this case:
[46]        I will deal with each in turn.
[47]        The key issue in this case was the question of whether the condensation that was appearing on the inside of windows in many of the units in the Plaintiff’s building was the Defendant’s responsibility, in warranty, contract, or tort.  Resolving that issue required an understanding of how a building envelope works as well as how windows were designed.  Conveying that understanding to the Court required expert evidence of a technical nature.
[48]        In other words, this matter was moderately complex.  This is a factor that favours a higher costs award and justifies the Defendant’s disbursements on the expert.
[49]        This factor also includes arguments about proportionality and is focused on whether the costs incurred are reasonable.  Some of the issues of proportionality are addressed above.
[50]        I start with the observation that more time was spent on this matter by the Plaintiff’s counsel than the Defendant’s counsel.  The Plaintiff, in their submissions, does not really take issue with the amount of time spent on this matter by Defendant’s counsel.  The Defendant, on the other hand, does point to the fact that there were more hours spent by the Plaintiff’s counsel.
[51]        The difference in the amount of time spent is not surprising to me, as the Defendant’s counsel has been practicing for significantly longer than the Plaintiff’s counsel, has more experience in these types of matters and a higher hourly rate.  In short, the bills submitted by both parties do not appear to be unreasonable and I see no basis to adjust the Defendant’s bill.
[52]        This is, in my view, a significant factor in this case.  I have described at paragraphs 7 to 13 above, the joint failure of the parties to either organize or rationalize the documents in this case in a way that would meaningfully assist the Court.
[53]        In their first round of submissions, both counsel either did not recognize or chose to ignore my concerns in this regard.  It was only after I specifically directed the parties to make submissions on this issue that I actually got submissions.
[54]        Both counsel took essentially the same position.  They were prepared to forego a claim for costs for the day and a half of time that was spent in Court trying to organize the documents.  This was between $4,000 (for the Plaintiff’s costs) and $6,000 (for the Defendant's costs).
[55]        In my view, this is not nearly enough of a reduction in costs for this lack of organization.  The joint failure of the parties to organize the materials both delayed the hearing of the matter and made the consideration of the issues significantly more difficult once the evidence had been received.  I will spell out what the organizational expectations for a trial (particularly a ZOOM trial) are, and then I will address some of the case-law on this issue.
[56]        I directed the parties to Cunningham on several occasions, including at the outset of the trial.  In that decision, which was released more than three years before the trial in this matter, the Court stated (at paras. 33 and 34):
[57]        The preparation of a joint book of documents is something that counsel should do prior to appearing in Court to conduct a trial.  This task is especially important when the matter is a trial that is proceeding remotely.  It is essential for all parties to be, literally, “on the same page” during the trial.  The preparation of this joint book is the joint responsibility of the parties’ counsel.  It is not sufficient to say, “well the other side didn’t want to do it” or “we couldn’t agree” or “we didn’t discuss it”.
[58]        The Court’s expectation is that parties represented by counsel will agree on documents that can be agreed upon prior to trial and will ensure that only one copy of those documents is provided to the Court.  Where a party does not participate in that exercise, they run the risk of adverse cost consequences. While it takes two to actually reach an agreement, both sides have an obligation to try and get an agreement.  The parties are also expected to answer the questions in Cunningham before the start of the trial.
[59]        Agreeing on the joint book of documents is one of the pre-trial steps that parties should be expected to take in order to streamline the trial.  These steps are more generally set out in The Advocates Society’s Best Practices for Civil Trials, which was published in June of 2015.  Those practices have also been approved by the Courts, including the Divisional Court:  Saleh v. Nebel 2018 ONSC 452 at para. 139.
[60]        That was not the only problem in this case.  The lack of hyperlinking was directly contrary to the Consolidated Provincial Practice Direction that was in place at the time, and more specifically the following provisions:
[61]        Not hyperlinking documents in a trial with electronic records is much like, in the old world of paper records, filing a book of documents with no tabs.  I cannot claim credit for this observation, as I know it has been made by more than one of my colleagues at various advocacy courses since CaseLines was introduced.  It has also been noted in previous case-law:  Lepp v. The Regional Municipality of York, 2022 ONSC 6978 at para. 9.
[62]        In this case, some of the document books were in excess of 500 pages.  The lack of hyperlinks on the table of contents was, to put it mildly, a problem when it came time for me to navigate through the evidence and reach my decision.
[63]        Then, there are the CaseLines page references.  This is not specifically addressed in the Practice Direction.  However, to state the obvious, the Court needs to be directed to the page references in the actual Court file rather than the page references in counsel’s copy of the materials.  Otherwise, time will be wasted by the Court in cross-referencing the pages.
[64]        All three of these issues were significant enough for me to require counsel to comment on them in their costs submissions.  Defendant’s counsel acknowledged that there was a failure on the part of counsel to properly and cooperatively agree on documentation and ensure that it was hyperlinked in advance of trial.  The Plaintiff’s counsel spent some time explaining the unsuccessful efforts that were taken after the trial started to organize the documents.  Regardless of the explanations, the Court’s requirements were not met.  With these problems and explanations in mind, I now turn to the law.
[65]        As part of my reasons, I directed counsel to the decision in Seelal v. Seelal, 2024 ONSC 4176.  In that decision, Trimble J. outlined some significant problems with the materials that the parties had submitted for a long motion that he was scheduled to hear.  The materials were so poorly organized that Trimble J. could not conduct the hearing.  Although Trimble J. was able to conduct a pre-trial instead of hearing a long motion, he made the following observations:
[66]        Had Trimble J. not been able to use the day to conduct a pre-trial, he went on to observe that he would have ordered that neither party’s counsel could charge their parties for the costs of either the day or of reconfiguring or re-uploading their materials.
[67]        Other judges have considered the issue of what should be done when parties and counsel fail to follow the Court’s practice directions or otherwise engage in conduct that tends to lengthen the litigation.  For example, in Ramdoo v. Houlden, 2024 ONSC 5994, the Court was faced with a circumstance where the practice directions were not being followed in respect of factums.  The Court found that it was not appropriate to order costs against counsel personally in those circumstances.  The Court was vexed by Counsel’s conduct but determined that there were no real tools available to the Court under the Family Law Rules to impose sanctions.
[68]        However, in Carroll v. McEwen, 2018 ONCA 902, (2018) 143 O.R. (3d) 641, the Court observed (at para. 65):
[69]        In other words, a trial judge has the jurisdiction to reduce the costs of a successful party on the basis of their counsel’s conduct as long as that reduction is warranted and proportionate.
[70]        In terms of finding an amount that is warranted and proportionate, it is worth considering the decision in Rodas v. Toronto Transit Commission 2012 ONSC 5662.  In that case, the Court observed (at para. 25):
[71]        Although this was not a jury trial, Wilson J.’s (as she then was) observations still apply.  The failure of parties to agree on basic trial management issues will, of necessity, make the trial longer.  The time wasted by that failure will not just be limited to the time that the Court spent trying to achieve an agreement.  Although it will be difficult to quantify, the wasted time will run throughout the trial.
[72]        Ultimately, costs are discretionary.  However, costs are also not automatic.  They have to be earned.  Uploading the work of organizing the case and tracking the documents to the Court is not earning your costs.  All it does is lengthen the trial and make the Court’s job harder.  Similarly, the lack of organization and adherence to the practice direction in this case was a significant issue that, again, lengthened the trial and made the Court’s job harder.
[73]        I agree with Trimble J. that the time when only an apology is sufficient for these sorts of failures is long past.  We are at the point where the Court must enforce the expectations that are set out in the Practice Direction and required by good advocacy.
[74]        The proposal that the Court should simply not allow costs for the day and a half of actual Court time that was thrown away because the organizational work was not done is also not sufficient to address the significance of the omissions.  In this case, the deduction to the Defendant’s costs would be approximately three (3) percent, which is a rounding error.  Instead, these types of omissions should attract a more substantial reduction in costs as the problems that these types of omissions create are more substantial than the mere loss of a day of in-court time and the rules are well known.
[75]        I acknowledge that the deduction in costs from the Defendant may advantage the Plaintiff because they do not have to pay costs that were otherwise payable.  However, the responsibilities are a joint responsibility and the only way that the Court can enforce these responsibilities is through the vehicle of costs awards.
[76]        As a result, on the facts of this case, I am reducing the Defendant’s costs by $25,000.00 on account of the failures to prepare, or even attempting to prepare, a joint book of documents, file documents that were properly hyperlinked and generally adhere to the practice directions.  While costs are discretionary, going forward all counsel should keep the risk of these types of deductions in mind when they are preparing for and conducting motions, applications and trials.
[77]        The Plaintiff had some very modest success on this matter in respect of the warranty, and should be entitled to an appropriately modest deduction in respect of the costs otherwise payable to account for that success.  I would normally have reduced the Defendant’s costs from $178,902.93 to approximately $150,000.00 to account for that modest success.
[78]        I also have set out my reasons for a further deduction of $25,000.00 from the Defendant’s costs on account of the record in this case.  Accordingly, I fix costs in this matter in the sum of $125,000.00, inclusive of HST and disbursements payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.  Costs are to be payable within thirty (30) days of today’s date.
