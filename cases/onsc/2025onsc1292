[1]              
The plaintiff is a lender suing on a mortgage loan over 519-7 Grenville
St. Toronto, ON (the “Property”), such loan given to the defendant Harrison
Roy.  It also sues on a guarantee given by Trung Tran.
[2]              
The defendants failed to defend the proceeding and were noted in
default.
[3]              
The plaintiff brings a motion for default judgment seeking damages, an
order for possession of the Property, leave to issue a Writ of Possession
against the Property, and an Order directing the Registrar to issue Writs of
Seizure and Sale. The plaintiff served the defendants with this motion.
[4]              
For the reasons that follow I am granting the judgment in the amount of
$ 896,275.67 an Order for possession as well as the Writ of Possession. I do
not order the Registrar to issue the Writ of Seizure and Sale as a court order
is not required for this.
[5]              
The main issues are:
[6]              
Pursuant to r. 19.02, having not defended the proceeding, a defendant is
deemed to admit the truth of all allegations of fact made in the Statement of
Claim.
[7]              
However, pursuant to r. 19.06 a
plaintiff is not entitled to judgment on a motion for judgment or at a trial
merely because the facts alleged in the statement of claim are deemed to be
admitted, unless the facts entitle the plaintiff to judgment.
[8]              
In particular, r. 19.05
provides that a motion for judgment which involves unliquidated damages shall
be supported by evidence given by affidavit.
[9]              
The test on a motion for default judgement was set out in Elekta Ltd.
v. Rodkin, 2012 CarswellOnt 2928 (ONSC) as follows: A. What deemed
admissions of fact flow from the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim? B. Do
those deemed admissions of fact entitle the plaintiff, as a matter of law, to
judgement on the claim? C. If they do not, has the plaintiff adduced admissible
evidence which, when combined with the deemed admissions, entitle it to
judgement on the pleaded claim?
[10]          
I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established liability based upon
the following deemed admissions in the Statement of Claim together with the
affidavit evidence filed:
[11]          
The outstanding balance on the mortgage as of November 1, 2024, is
$896,275.67 in principal and interest. Therefore, I am awarding this amount as
against Harrison Roy on the mortgage and as against Trung Tran in respect of
his guarantee.
[12]          
I award this amount with pre and post judgment interest at the contract
rate of 19 %.
[13]          
Pursuant to r. 60.10 “the court may grant the court may grant leave to
issue a writ of possession only when it is satisfied that all persons in actual
possession of any part of the land have received sufficient notice of the
proceeding in which the order was obtained to have enabled them to apply to the
court for relief.” See also Hyungjong Kim, 2022 ONSC 2731 at para 19.
[14]          
The plaintiff has provided evidence that the home is owner occupied
only.  Therefore, I grant the writ of possession.
[15]          
I do not grant the Writ of Seizure and Sale as pursuant to r. 60.07 the
creditor is entitled to one upon filing with the registrar a copy of the order.
Leave is only required if six or more years have elapsed since the date of the
order which is not the case here.
[16]          
The plaintiff’s draft order seeks costs in the amount of $12,056.51 on a
substantial indemnity basis for the costs incurred prior to bringing the action
and $18,006.55 in respect of the costs of the motion on a substantial indemnity
basis.
[17]          
The mortgage entitles the plaintiff to its costs on a substantial
indemnity basis.
[18]          
However, some of the costs incurred related to the need for the
plaintiff to address certain deficiencies including service issues.
[19]          
Therefore, I reduce the costs to $20,000 in respect of all costs, which
I find reasonable and within the reasonable contemplation of the defendants.
[20]          
The plaintiff shall send me a revised Judgment.
[21]          
I award pre and post judgment interest at the contract rate of 19 %
commencing on November 1, 2024.
