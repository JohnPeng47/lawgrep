[1]              
The plaintiffs, Tyler Hogan and TGH Holdings
Ltd. (“Hogan” and “TGH”), bring this motion seeking judgment which includes the
following:
[2]              
Thunder Bay Broom and Chemical Ltd. (the “Company”)
was founded in or around 1980 and is in the business of distributing sanitation
supplies, personal protective equipment, commercial cleaning equipment and
appliances, as well as providing repair and maintenance services for the
equipment sold.
[3]              
Hogan and Massaro purchased an ownership
interest in the Company in 2007.  As of 2014, through their respective holding
corporations – TGH and BJSM – Hogan and Massaro each owned an equal 50% share
in the Company.
[4]              
By November 2020, Hogan became concerned that
Massaro was engaging in financial misconduct relating to the Company.  Hogan’s
evidence, filed in support of this motion, indicates that Massaro and other Company
employees were working together to run product through the Company without
proper documentation and accounting.  There was also concern at that time that
Massaro was competing with the Company through other entities owned by Massaro
and/or other Company employees who were working with Massaro.
[5]              
Hogan attempted to discuss the misconduct he
identified with Massaro, including the diversion of corporate opportunities,
theft of inventory, selling product in non-arms length transactions at reduced
margins, and purchasing product from companies owned or related to Massaro at
increased prices.  Massaro refused to participate in these discussions, and
Hogan’s access to financial records, including year end financials and
financial statements, became limited.  Without sufficient transparency that
Massaro’s dealings involving the Company were not contrary to the financial
interests of the Company, Hogan and TGH issued a statement of claim against
Massaro and BJSM seeking a proper accounting and for Massaro to purchase
Hogan’s interest in the Company.
[6]              
The background to this litigation is set out
with some detail in the Endorsement of Fregeau J. dated November 7, 2023. 
Without repeating the entire history, some of the relevant events are as
follows:
[7]              
Without any participation by the defendants in
this action, the plaintiffs maintain that they have been unable to obtain
detailed information and background to the Massaro’s alleged financial
misconduct.  The effect of Massaro’s conduct, and his failure to provide any
disclosure of evidence or documents in response to Hogan’s claim, is described
by Hogan as follows:
[8]              
“Semple” is Titus Semple, a former employee of
the Company allegedly working with Massaro.  “510” is 5106927 Ontario Ltd., a
numbered company owned by Massaro through which he conducts business.
[9]              
Hogan’s evidence was accepted by Fregeau J.. In
his reasons supporting Hogan’s motion to strike, Fregeau J. determined the
following:
[10]          
Therefore, it is clear that Massaro and BJSM
have deliberately ignored Hogan and TGH’s claim – and intentionally failed to
respond to the previous orders requiring production of documents and
participation in an examination for discovery – in an attempt to thwart Hogan
and TGH’s efforts to determine the extent to which Massaro and BJSM impacted
the Company’s economic interests.
[11]          
Counsel for the defendants, Derek Zulianello, appeared
at this motion hearing.  Mr. Zulianello sought leave to address the motion over
the objection of the plaintiffs, and I declined to hear from him.
[12]          
The defendants have been noted in default and notice
of this motion was provided to Mr. Zulianello simply as a courtesy.  Effectively,
the defendants no longer have standing to participate in this proceeding due to
the operation of rr. 19.02(1)(b) and 19.02(3) the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”).  In addition, based on the decision
of Fregeau J. in granting default judgment, it is plain and obvious that the
defendants intentionally squandered their opportunity to participate in this
litigation.  Without a reason to question the findings of Fregeau J., I decided
that Mr. Zulianello’s continued participation in this motion was limited to
being simply an observer.
[13]          
Rule 19 of the Rules deals with default
proceedings.
[14]          
The relevant provisions of the Rules, as
relied upon by Hogan and TGH, are as follows:
[15]          
The plaintiffs rely on these two provisions for
the principle that obtaining a default judgement requires that all “deemed
admissions of fact, together with any facts adduced at the hearing must entitle
the plaintiff to judgement on the claim as a matter of law”.  As stated in Churchill
v. Aero Auction Sales Inc., 2019 ONSC 4766, 147 O.R. (3d) 44, at para. 18:
[16]          
The plaintiffs also rely on Paul’s Transport Inc.
v. Immediate Logistics Limited, 2022 ONCA 573, 472 D.L.R. (4th) 359, at
para. 80:
[17]          
Accordingly, I am to take the facts set out
within the statement of claim, consider which facts can be deemed admissions,
and then review the evidence filed by Hogan to determine whether to grant
judgment.
[18]          
After reviewing the statement of claim and the
affidavit of Tyler Hogan sworn August 8, 2024, the paragraphs within this
section of my decision set out my findings of fact.
[19]          
Hogan and Massaro are business partners in the
Company.  Hogan holds his interest in the Company through TGH, and Massaro holds
his interest in the Company through BJSM.  Hogan and Massaro are the Company’s
sole shareholders on a 50/50 basis. Each owns 50% of the Company, through TGH
and BJSM, respectively.
[20]          
Historically, the practice of Massaro and Hogan
in their dealings with the Company has been to require unanimity for
significant corporate decisions.
[21]          
Massaro maintains another company, known as
5106927 Ontario Ltd. (“510”), through which he conducts business.
[22]          
Jared Fanti (“Fanti”) began working for the
Company in March 2020 as an account manager.  He is the sole owner of
1000197104 Ontario Ltd. (“JMF”), which operates in substantially the same
business as the Company.  Fanti resigned from the Company on January 19, 2024.
[23]          
Titus Semple (“Semple”) worked for the Company
in marketing and sales commencing in May 2016.  Semple Enterprises Inc. was
formed on December 4, 2020, with Semple as its sole officer and director, and
serves some of the same clients as the Company. Semple resigned from the
Company on December 29, 2023.
[24]          
The Company’s office is located at 125 West Gore
Street, Thunder Bay, Ontario, and provides janitorial and sanitation products
to customers throughout Northwestern Ontario.  In addition to its office, the
Company maintains a warehouse located at 117 West Gore Street, Thunder Bay (the
“Warehouse”).
[25]          
Massaro historically worked in the office and
managed the Company’s finances. Hogan historically worked in the field,
managing vendor relationships, procurement, and sales for the Company. 
However, starting in late 2020, Massaro began to withdraw from the Company,
requiring Hogan to take on his responsibilities.  As of late 2020, Massaro no
longer had a consistent presence in the Company’s office.
[26]          
At the present time, Hogan manages the Warehouse
of products and the office, and completes equipment maintenance for customers
in and around Thunder Bay.
[27]          
Before 2020, Hogan had access to information
related to the Company’s financial position. However, between 2020 and 2023
many decisions regarding the Company’s finances were withheld or hidden from
Hogan by Massaro and Nanette Bonner, the Company’s former general manager.
[28]          
Since 2020, limited financial information
relating to the Company has been shared with Hogan, and Hogan’s questions
regarding the Company’s financial matters have gone unanswered.  Since 2020, Massaro
has stopped preparing basic financial statements for the Company and has failed
to respond to Hogan’s requests for financial statements or year end processes. 
While some financial information and disclosure have been provided to Hogan
since 2023, this does not include the full financial disclosure to which he is
entitled.
[29]          
Massaro’s conduct effectively excluded Hogan
from the Company’s governance and management, despite Hogan’s roles as
director, officer, and employee.
[30]          
As of November 2020, Massaro’s conduct was
consistent with him engaging in financial misconduct at the expense of the
Company, including his reluctance to respond to requests regarding the
Company’s financial dealings and his withdrawal from the Warehouse to a
separate office with Semple and Fanti.
[31]          
At this same time, Hogan noticed that large
quantities of product were coming into the Warehouse without packing slips and
being shipped to end users without any Company orders or invoices attached to
them.
[32]          
Hogan became concerned that Massaro was
competing with the Company through other entities, and upon investigating
further he was able to identify financial misconduct, including indications of
diversion of corporate opportunities, theft of Company inventory, selling of
Company product to Semple and/or his company at reduced margins, and causing
the Company to purchase product such as steri-wipes and masks from Massaro’s
company without proper corporate authorization.
[33]          
When confronted with these issues, Massaro did
not deny nor respond to Hogan’s information.
[34]          
By the end of 2021, Massaro refused to engage in
preparations of the year-end financials or provide necessary information for
the Company’s accountant to prepare financial statements.
[35]          
In July 2022, Hogan commenced this action
against Massaro. As already outlined, Massaro has more or less ignored this
litigation and refused to actively respond to or participate in the litigation
process.
[36]          
Once Nanette Bonner, the Company’s General
Manager, was dismissed in June 2023, Hogan was able to get access to additional
financial information evidencing Massaro’s misconduct, including instances when
Massaro took money from the Company without explanation, or caused the Company
to pay for products and services it never received.
[37]          
Instances of inventory theft and fraud committed
by Massaro include the following:
[38]          
Instances of improper invoicing from 510 to the
Company include the following:
[39]          
Massaro also authorized the Company to pay
expense claims totalling $95,624.07, which were coded in the Company’s
accounting system as Repairs and Maintenance for the Warehouse, but were never
received.  Cheques in the following amounts payable to the following businesses
were authorized and signed by Massaro:
[40]          
The work described in the invoices from the
above businesses does not reflect work that would have been required in the
Warehouse. Instead, these claims are consistent with work that would be
required for Massaro’s personal or rental properties, unrelated to the Company.
[41]          
Since 2020, charges to Massaro’s Company credit
card total $661,326.18.  While some of these charges properly relate to Company
business, personal charges relating to Massaro – totalling $28,399.52 – were
incorrectly coded in the Company’s journals as business expenses.
[42]          
Fanti, through JFM, invoiced the Company on
December 1, 2023, for $6,622.93 for items he purchased as part of his job. 
Massaro directed the Company to process a cheque payable to Fanti for these
amounts on December 2, 2023.  However, Fanti had purchased these items in September
2023 using his Company credit card. As such, when Fanti submitted an invoice
dated December 1, 2023, and when Massaro directed payment on December 2, 2023,
these items had already been paid for by the Company.
[43]          
Semple was paid as a Company employee from
December 2015 to December 29, 2023.  However, Semple stopped working for the
Company during the summer of 2022, and notwithstanding, Massaro directed that
Semple continue to be paid until January 2024.
[44]          
Massaro also directed the Company to sell
product to Semple Enterprises at an underpriced cost or at no cost at all,
including the following:
[45]          
Between April 2022 and May 2024, a review of the
Company’s books shows that selling Semple Enterprises underpriced inventory and
goods resulted in a loss to the Company of approximately $48,171.19.  In
addition, despite the fact Semple Enterprises failed to pay many of the
invoices for goods it received, Massaro continued to authorize the shipment and
delivery of inventory and goods.  Out of the $278,279.21 in total billings to
Semple Enterprises, the Company only received $15,140.26 in payment, leaving an
unpaid shortfall in the amount of $263,138.95.
[46]          
Accounts managed by Massaro, Fanti, and Semple
for the Company remain in arrears, and Massaro has refused to collect on these
outstanding accounts receivable.  Employees working in the Company’s accounting
department were directed by Massaro not to collect payment on various
outstanding invoices for accounts managed and controlled by Massaro, Fanti, and
Semple.  The total amount of accounts receivable in this regard was
$3,527,424.64 as of August 2023. As of May 2024, collection efforts have reduced
this amount to $1,664,642.06.
[47]          
Based on the evidence presented, and the deemed
admissions engaged as a result of the defendants’ default, I find that Massaro
has ceased acting honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the
Company by engaging in a pattern of diverting business opportunities to
companies owned by the defendants and/or their associates.
[48]          
In terms of diverting the Company’s corporate
opportunities, Massaro’s efforts resulted in Mishkeegogamang First Nation ordering
product from Massaro, Semple, and Fanti which was historically supplied by the
Company.  Since 2022, this is but one example of the notable decrease in orders
from the Company’s historic First Nations clients, all of whom were previously
managed by Massaro, Semple, and Fanti.
[49]          
For the 2019 to 2022 fiscal years, the annual
sales for First Nations clients amounted to $4.8 million, $5.6 million, and
$4.3 million, respectively.  However, during the years 2023 and 2024, sales for
those clients decreased to $2.5 million and $2.1 million annually.
[50]          
The lost sales resulting from Massaro’s
diversion of opportunities is estimated to be in an amount of $3.5 million to
the date of this motion.
[51]          
As noted in the outset of these reasons, the
plaintiffs are seeking judgment in the form of an oppression remedy.
[52]          
Hogan and TGH rely on s. 248 of the Business
Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (the “OBCA”), which prescribes
oppression remedies in certain situations:
[53]          
The plaintiffs rely on the case of BCE Inc.
v. 1976 Debentureholders, 2008 SCC 69, 3 S.C.R. 560, which outlines the
requirements under the OBCA to grant an oppression remedy.  The Supreme Court
states the following at para. 68 of its decision:
[54]          
Following this two-part test, the plaintiffs
submit first that Hogan had reasonable expectations, and second, that Massaro
violated these expectations.
[55]          
I will now examine the case law presented by the
plaintiffs in support of their position, with respect to both questions.
[56]          
The case law recognizes that any consideration
of a corporate stakeholders’ reasonable expectations is a contextual question. 
However, there is general acceptance for the position that it is reasonable to
expect fair treatment, compliance with the OBCA, and that directors will
fulfill their fiduciary obligations by acting honestly and in good faith.
[57]          
The plaintiffs rely on para. 82 of BCE Inc.
v. 1976 Debentureholders, 2008 SCC 69, 3 S.C.R. 560 specifically, to
support this proposition:
[58]          
Para. 93 of D’Antonio v. Monaco, 2013
ONSC 5007, further clarifies this principle:
[59]          
And in Peoples Department Stores Ltd. (Trustee
of) v. Wise, 2004 SCC 68, 3 S.C.R. 461, para. 35 provides the scope of
reasonable expectations:
[60]          
Each of these cases support the plaintiffs’
position that Hogan, as a 50% owner and long-term business partner of the Company,
had a reasonable expectation that Massaro would not breach his fiduciary
duties, which include the duty to act in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders. This necessarily includes the reasonable expectation that, as
a director, Massaro would refrain from self-dealing, diversion of
opportunities, and acting in conflict-of-interest situations. Therefore, by
virtue of their positions within the company as directors, both Hogan and
Massaro were obliged to respect their fiduciary duties, and each had the
reasonable expectation that the other would also comply.
[61]          
Claimants may seek oppression remedies even
where a portion of the harm caused by the impugned actions technically accrues
to the corporation, and not the individual:  see Malata Group (HK) Ltd. v.
Jung, 2008 ONCA 111, 89 O.R. (3d) 36, at paras. 29-31.
[62]          
Accordingly, it is no obstacle to Hogan’s claim
for an oppression remedy that his claim may also constitute a derivative action,
because the two are not mutually exclusive.
[63]          
The evidence provided thus far demonstrates that
Massaro engaged in self-dealing and used his position within the Company to
fraudulently divert company funds. He also acted while in a
conflict-of-interest by knowingly arranging for the purchase of products below
market value by a company in which he had a personal interest.
[64]          
Hogan and TGH rely on the case of Veolio ES
Industrial Services Inc. v. Brule, 2012 ONCA 173 to support the proposition
that Massaro’s behaviour manifestly violated his fiduciary duties of honesty,
loyalty, non-competition, and non-usurpation:
[65]          
Paras. 73–76 of Interhealth Canada Ltd. v.
O’Keefe, 2023 ONCA 368 summarizes the Supreme Court’s ruling in Canaero
v. O’Malley 1973 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1974] S.C.R. 592:
[66]          
The plaintiffs characterize Massaro’s behaviour
as “usurping for himself” or “diverting” as described by the Supreme Court. 
While the resignation of Massaro is not in issue, his conduct in removing
himself from the operations of the Company is akin to a resignation in the
sense that his actions outside the day-to-day business of the Company
negatively impacted the interests of the plaintiffs.
[67]          
The plaintiffs further argue that personal
liability against Massaro is appropriate in this case. In support of their
position, they rely on the following test set out in Wilson v. Alharayeri,
2017 SCC 39, 1 S.C.R. 1037:
[68]          
In this case, by virtue of Massaro being
directly implicated in the impugned conduct, both prongs of the test are met,
and personal liability is appropriate. Wilson further provides guidance
as to a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered when deciding whether
personal liability is appropriate as a remedy:
[69]          
Therefore, the totality of factors in this case
– such as Massaro’s personal benefit from the conduct, the breach of fiduciary
duty, and Massaro’s misuse of his director position – all weigh in favour of
imposing personal liability against Massaro in his role as director, rather
than against the Company as a whole.
[70]          
Sidaplex-Plastic Suppliers, Inc. v. Elta
Group Inc. (1995), 1995 CanLII 7419 (ON SC), 131 D.L.R. (4th) 399, at paras.
24-26, pp. 406-407, also speaks to personal liability for oppression remedies:
[71]          
The plaintiffs characterize Massaro’s conduct as
being directly beneficial to him, as well as a product of his misuse of his
director powers. I agree.  Therefore, and in relying on previous jurisprudence,
Massaro should not be permitted to hide behind his corporate personality and
should instead be held personally liable.
[72]          
The plaintiffs again rely on the Supreme Court
in Wilson for the proposition that, in issuing an oppression remedy, the
court has a broad discretionary power to fashion just and contextual remedies
under s. 241 of the OBCA:
[73]          
The plaintiffs suggest the following to be
factors that must be considered in crafting an appropriate remedy in this case:
[74]          
Given the totality of factors, Hogan and TGH
suggest that the appropriate remedy would be a buyout. They rely on several
cases in support of this position.
[75]          
The plaintiffs rely on C.I. Covington Fund
Inc. v. White (2000), 10 B.L.R. (3d) 183 to support, first, that a
restraining order is not an appropriate remedy, and second, that the court has
a broad discretion when it comes to crafting an appropriate oppression remedy:
[76]          
In 2082825 Ontario Inc. v. Platinum Wood
Finishing Inc. (2009), 2009 CanLII 14394 (ON SCDC), 96 O.R. (3d) 467, the Divisional Court upheld a
trial judge’s discretionary oppression remedy.  This case provides some
guidance on the scope of the court’s authority, and how it may be assessed on
appeal:
[77]          
The plaintiffs rely on Larmon v. Synergy
Hospitality Inc. (2004), 2004 CanLII 2562 (ON SC), 1 B.L.R. (4th) 244 in support of their position
that it would be unreasonable for the court to order that Hogan and Massaro
remain in business together, and that it is within the court’s authority to
grant a buyout remedy:
[78]          
Based on Massaro’s recent conduct, as described
by Hogan and confirmed in the default judgment decision of Fregeau J., there is
clearly no way forward in the Company if it is predicated on both Massaro and
Hogan working together.  A buyout remedy is the most effective and appropriate way
to address Massaro’s misconduct in the circumstances.
[79]          
To summarize, the plaintiffs put forth the
following arguments in support of their position that a buyout remedy granted
pursuant to s.248 of the OBCA, in the context of a default proceeding
pursuant to r. 19 of the Rules, is the appropriate and just remedy in
this case:
[80]          
I agree with the positions of the plaintiffs.
[81]          
Based on the foregoing submissions, I am
satisfied that the appropriate remedy would be for Massaro to buy out Hogan’s
interests in the Company.
[82]          
What, then, would be the appropriate valuation
of the Company for the purposes of the buy out?
[83]          
Any valuation must reflect the fair value of the
Company, a value which is assessed on the assumption that there is no
oppressive conduct that could arguably impact that value.  In this regard, I
agree with Hogan that any buy out figure which is determined without accounting
for Massaro’s misconduct would be inequitable and effectively provide Massaro
with a windfall.
[84]          
To provide an assessment of the valuation of the
Company, Hogan and TGH Holdings retained Kathryn Gosnell (“Gosnell”), who is a
Chartered Accountant, Chartered Professional Accountant, Chartered Financial
Analyst, Chartered Business Valuator and Senior Director at Kroll Canada
Limited.  Along with a copy of her Curriculum Vitae and an executed
Acknowledgment of Expert’s Duty, Gosnell prepared an expert report dated August
9, 2024 (the “Report”).
[85]          
In reviewing her CV, along with the signed Form
53, I accept her as an expert qualified to provide a fair market valuation of
the Company based on several scenarios.
[86]          
Paragraph 1.1 of the Report provides the basis
for Gosnell’s opinion.
[87]          
She indicates that she was retained to provide
an opinion as to the fair value of the 50% common shareholding in the company
as of February 29, 2024 (the “Valuation Date”) based on four alternative
assumptions:
[88]          
A summary of the valuation opinions of Gosnell
for each of the scenarios is provided in chart form within the Report as
follows:
[89]          
In reviewing the Report, it is clear that the Company’s
revenues since 2017 have been significant. The revenues during the years 2017
to 2019 were in the range of $3 million to $4 million annually. These increased
during the pandemic given the nature of the Company’s business being focused on
sanitation products. As such, the Company’s annual revenues for 2020, 2021, and
2022 ranged between $7 million and just under $8 million.
[90]          
In terms of the EBITDA figures, between the
years 2017 and 2019, these ranged from approximately $1 million to $1.5
million. For the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the EBITDA figures fell somewhere
between $2.5 million and $3 million.
[91]          
In contrast, the annual revenue in 2023 and 2024
was just over $4 million, with the EBITDA amounts falling somewhere in the
range of $1.6 million.
[92]          
In terms of the assets that existed as of the
valuation date, Gosnell noted the following:
[93]          
There are also some liabilities of the Company
which were noted as of the valuation date, these being accounts payable of $1
million and a debt of $40,000 relating to a delivery truck.
[94]          
There are two generally accepted approaches to assessing
value: the going concern approach and the liquidation approach. Gosnell used
the going concern approach based on the Company's history of positive earnings
and cash flows and the anticipation that the company would continue to be
profitable in the future, with positive working capital to cover its
liabilities.
[95]          
Gosnell also clearly stated in the Report that
her opinions with respect to Scenarios 3 and 4 were based upon assumptions that
$300,000 and $600,000 were incurred by the Company as annual expenses resulting
from Massaro’s alleged misconduct during the years 2020 to 2024.  This is to be
contrasted with Scenario 2, in which Gosnell attempts to quantify the value of
the alleged misconduct as described by Hogan and as set out within his
affidavit materials. This method is summarized in Schedule 5.2-1 of her report.
[96]          
It is worth noting at this juncture that the
evidence from Hogan is based, in part, on evidence obtained by a Company
employee involved in the accounting department.  As such, while the opinions
relating to Scenario 2 are based on Hogan’s evidence, Scenario 3 and Scenario 4
are based only on Hogan’s assumptions. No investigative accounting has been
undertaken to independently confirm these assumptions.
[97]          
In Scenario 2, after reviewing the summary of
alleged misconduct by Massaro and as detailed by Hogan, found at Schedule 5.2-1
of the Report, the adjustments for each year from 2020 to 2024 vary.  While
that may be due to the limited evidence available for each of these years,
Hogan clearly had access to internal accounting information which he used to
piece together what Massaro was doing.  As such, it is possible that Hogan was
unable to access or identify all of Massaro’s misconduct, but it is clear that Scenario
2 represents the situation based upon what Hogan actually knows.  Scenarios 3
and 4, on the other hand, attempt to consider additional but unidentifiable effects
of Massaro’s misconduct which Hogan speculates might exist.
[98]          
With respect to Scenario 2, in 2020 there is no
adjustment noted as a result of the misconduct.  In 2021, $600,888 is the value
of the EBITDA adjustment resulting from the alleged misconduct, as calculated
by Gosnell.  The figures for 2022, 2023, and 2024 are $23,852, $1,157,656 and
$1,269,274 respectively, with the total impact of Massaro’s misconduct, as
supported by Hogan’s evidence, valued at $3,051,671.
[99]          
Scenario 3 takes the adjustment figures from
Scenario 2 and adds another $1.5 million representing $300,000 per year from
2020 to 2024.
[100]      
Scenario 4 applies a different assumption, using
an estimated annual amount of $600,000 over five years to add to the Scenario 2
assessment, i.e., applying another $3 million to account for Massaro’s unknown
misconduct.
[101]      
During counsel’s submissions, I was urged to
adopt either Scenario 3 or Scenario 4 circumstances when valuing the Company
for the purposes of defining the parameters of the oppression remedy.  As I
understand the submission, Hogan knows Massaro conducted himself in a number of
ways to impact Hogan’s financial interest in the Company.  The information and
belief of Hogan is found within his affidavit filed in support of this motion.
[102]      
However, based on Hogan’s limited knowledge of
Massaro’s misconduct, which could have been better explored and identified if
Massaro did not intentionally avoid participating in this litigation -
including the discovery process – it is argued that there must be more
misconduct which is not known.  As such, in assessing damages, the plaintiffs
submit that the court should notionally attribute either $300,000 or $600,000
per year for five years – 2020 to 2024 – to account for that unknown
misconduct.
[103]      
Accepting Gosnell’s figures presented in her
analysis, there is a significant difference in damages when comparing Scenario
2 to Scenarios 3 and 4.
[104]      
I do not find, however, that there is enough of
an evidentiary basis to depart from Scenario 2 – which is based on the evidence
provided by Hogan – and use Scenario 3 or Scenario 4 in order to calculate the value
of the Company.
[105]      
The assumptions used in Scenarios 3 and 4 are
simply that:  assumptions.  There is no evidence available to support a
$300,000 or $600,000 annual variation in the figures determined to apply to
Scenario 2.  The assumptions presented in Scenarios 3 and 4 rely upon the
initial premise of Massaro’s misconduct being worse than that assessed in
Scenario 2.  I appreciate the arguments being advanced, and the sense of
justice associated with adopting the plaintiffs’ assertion that, where there is
known misconduct, there must be more which has further impacted the valuation
of the Company in Massaro’s favour.  This position is made even more attractive
by Massaro’s refusal and unwillingness to participate in this litigation.
[106]      
Why should Massaro benefit from any misconduct
which the plaintiffs have been unable to prove or demonstrate because of
Massaro’s own delinquency in actively dodging this action?  Is not the
prejudice suffered by the plaintiffs in advancing a clear and cogent valuation
of the Company, based upon a fulsome record of evidence, enough to allow the
court to consider Scenarios 3 or 4?
[107]      
A plaintiff may only recover damages which are
caused by a defendant’s wrong.  There must be a causal connection between the
wrong and the damages, and the onus of establishing this connection is borne by
the plaintiff.  The standard of proof required to show that the defendant’s
breach of duty caused damages to a plaintiff is the balance of probabilities.
[108]      
Not only must the plaintiff prove the existence
of a loss caused by the defendant’s wrong, the plaintiff must also establish
the extent, or quantum, of the loss.  In other words, the plaintiff has the
onus to prove the amount of damage he or she has endured, and those damages
must also be established on a balance of probabilities.
[109]      
If there is no evidence adduced to support the
loss which is claimed and proven, then a court could hold the burden of proof
against the plaintiff and award no damages.  The onus of proving damages rests
upon a plaintiff.  In Cotter v. General Petroleums Ltd., 1950 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1951] S.C.R.
154, at pp. 175-176, a plaintiff was clearly out $1,000 due to the defendant’s actions
but sought additional damages above and beyond $1,000.  The court, in
considering the plaintiff’s position on damages, said that if damages exceeding
$1,000 were sought, these must be supported by the evidence, without which it
may be that there is or is not an actual loss.
[110]      
The onus lies on a plaintiff to prove its
damages on a reasonable preponderance of credible evidence:  see 100 Main
Street East Ltd. v. W.B. Sullivan Construction Ltd. (1978), 1978 CanLII 1630 (ON CA), 20 O.R. (2d)
401, at p. 33 (C.A.).
[111]      
Murano et al. v. Bank of Montreal and Peat
Marwick Thorne (1995), 1995 CanLII 7410 (ON SC), 31 C.B.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. Gen.
Div.), at para. 166, cites a passage from a South Carolina Court of Appeal
decision addressing the assessment of damages in these terms:
[112]      
The plaintiffs’ evidence suggests that Hogan was
unable to access accounting information relating to the Company for a period of
time. However, following Nannette Bonner’s dismissal in June 2023, Hogan was
once again able to access enough of the Company’s financial information in
order to inform himself and provide evidence as to the nature of Massaro’s misconduct.
[113]      
In addition, Hogan was able to work with an
employee of the Company – who is unnamed in this litigation for his or her
protection – and obtain access to more information relating to the financial
health of the Company.  This additional information forms part of Hogan’s
evidence in this matter and was provided to Gosnell in order to come up with
Scenario 2.
[114]      
It seems reasonable to assume that before coming
to court with this motion, the plaintiffs would have accessed as much evidence
as was available so that Gosnell could do her job and provide a proper
valuation analysis of the Company.  It may also be reasonable to assume that,
without Massaro’s participation in this litigation, there are a number of rocks
which remain unturned and, as such, the full extent of the Company’s valuation is
unknown.  But even the scope of the unknown remains unknown. Perhaps, given the
access to the financial records which Hogan  did have, the plaintiffs were actually
able to discover the full extent of Massaro’s misconduct.
[115]      
The opinion set out in the Report with respect
to Scenario 2 is based on facts that have been proven on a balance of
probabilities.
[116]      
The opinions set out in the Report with respect
to Scenarios 3 and 4 are not based on facts or evidence, but instead are based
upon pure assumptions.
[117]       Without sufficient evidentiary underpinnings, I decline to accept
the valuations proposed in Scenarios 3 and 4, and instead adopt Gosnell’s
opinion with respect to damages as set out in Scenario 2.
[118]      
A declaration shall issue pursuant to s. 248 of
the Business Corporations Act that Massaro and BJSM have engaged in or
caused conduct that is oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, and unfairly
disregarding of the interests of the plaintiffs in the Company.
[119]      
A declaration shall issue that Massaro and BJSM
breached their fiduciary duties owed to Hogan and TGH, and both Massaro and
BJSM are liable to Hogan and TGH for damages.
[120]      
In fashioning a remedy to address the oppressive
conduct and breach of fiduciary duties by Massaro and BJSM, it is appropriate
in the circumstances that Massaro and BJSM, jointly and severally, forthwith pay
damages to Hogan and TGH such that they purchase TGH shares in the Company for
$13,350,000 plus post-judgment interest as provided by the Court of Justice
Act.
[121]      
Upon full payment for the shares of the Company
as provided in the foregoing para.120, TGH shall transfer its shares in the
Company to BJSM or another designate of Massaro or BJSM.
[122]      
The plaintiffs are successful in their motion
and are entitled to their costs.
[123]      
The costs’ submissions of the plaintiffs seek
substantial indemnity costs in the amount of $55,000 inclusive of fees,
disbursements and HST.  This figure is based on all-in claims as follows: 
$43,101.01 in partial indemnity costs, $61,682.45 in substantial indemnity
costs, and $67,876.26 in actual costs.
[124]      
The two counsel who participated in this motion
are Daniel Rosenbluth, who was called in 2016, and Claire McNevin, who was
called in 2019.  Mr. Rosenbluth’s hourly rate is $600 while Ms. McNevin is
charged out at $550 an hour.
[125]      
Emma Wall, who appears to have done much of the
work organizing and putting the motion materials together, was called in 2022
and billed out at $450 an hour, adding $7,087.50 in partial indemnity, $10,631.25
in substantial indemnity, and $11,812,50 in actual fees to the bottom line.
[126]      
The argument in this matter took less than 2
hours.  In that a default judgment had been entered as against the defendants,
there was no need to prepare documents or arguments to address submissions from
Massaro and BJSM’s counsel.  There is no doubt that putting together the
materials in support of the relief sought, in addition to preparing for oral
argument, was not a simple task.  Reading the materials, which were well
drafted, and hearing submissions, which were focused on the material issues,
greatly assisted me in understanding this case and formulating my decision.
[127]      
However, despite the amount at issue being in
the millions of dollars, most of the heavy lifting to support the damages’
figures presented was done by Gosnell.  Therefore, counsel for the plaintiffs
did not have to prepare themselves to address the calculations of damages, save
and except to reference the difference in the four scenarios.  The efforts to
advance Hogan and TGH’s case would have been the same whether the damages in
question were $100,000 or $100 million.
[128]      
In other words, the amount at issue is not specifically
reflective of the effort required to advance the interests of the plaintiffs.
[129]      
Reviewing the considerations set out in r. 57.01,
I find that the amount sought of $55,000 would not be reasonably anticipated by
the defendants for a motion hearing that took less than two hours to argue in
the Northwest Region.
[130]      
I do find that this matter was not simple, and
involved issues of complexity both with respect to detailing the alleged
misconduct and the damages which flow from that misconduct.  In addition, it is
not possible to ignore the fact that the issues addressed in this matter were
of utmost important to the plaintiffs.
[131]      
An additional consideration when determining
costs is described in r. 57.01(1)(e).  The conduct of Massaro and BJSM
throughout this litigation has been irresponsible, and designed to thwart the
justice which Hogan and TGH were attempting to achieve.  On the face of this
conduct, it is reasonable to request a higher-than-normal scale of costs since
the actions of Massaro unduly complicated the overall litigation process.
[132]      
Having said that, without Massaro’s
participation in the motion, can it be said that the conduct of the defendants unnecessarily
lengthened the duration of this step in the proceeding?  Surely this conduct
must have complicated the efforts of Gosnell in her attempt to provide her
expert opinions.  To the extent that those complications impacted her efforts,
I assume that any consequential costs would be contained in her fee account,
which is not in issue.
[133]      
I do not find, however, that Massaro’s conduct
impacted the overall effort of the plaintiffs to argue the issues relating to
remedy and damages.  In fact, it is likely that Massaro’s absence made the
process easier and more streamlined.
[134]      
Awarding costs of $55,000 for a two-hour motion
in the Northwest Region would far exceed any other awards made for similar
efforts.  The time spent by several different lawyers on behalf of the
plaintiffs naturally increased the costs of this matter, which would not have
been the case if the same lawyer drafted the materials and then argued the
matter. Further, the hourly rates charged for the years of experience claimed is
not in line with the rates of counsel practicing in Northwestern Ontario.
[135]      
Considering all of these factors, some of which
support a healthy costs’ award while others do not, I find that an appropriate
award for costs in this matter is $25,000 inclusive of fees, disbursements and
HST.
[136]      
Interest on any amounts awarded in this decision
attracts interest at the appropriate rates provided by the Courts of Justice
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, as amended.
