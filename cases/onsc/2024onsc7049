This bitterly contested motion was just more proof that this has
quickly turned into a needlessly acrimonious file concerning two daughters ages
22 months and 6 months.
2                   
The background, briefly:
3                   
The father brought urgent motions.  Justice Brown attempted to
assist by giving them three urgent Case Conferences.
4                   
On June 4, 2024 Justice Brown granted a temporary without
prejudice order pursuant to a consent signed by the parties.  That order
included the father having time with Chloe:
5                   
The parties then scheduled a long motion to deal with all
temporary issues.  But when they discovered that it would take too long for
their long motion to be heard, they decided to adjourn the long motion, and
proceed by way of a short motion dealing only with parenting issues. And on
October 18, 2024 they consented to an order that pending the hearing of that
short motion, the father would have parenting time with the youngest child as
follows:
6                   
In the current motion, the parties seemed to be heading in
opposite directions in relation to the older child Chloe.
7                   
The competing proposals in relation to six-month-old Scarlett are
more challenging, mainly because of her age. The main dispute appears to relate
to the issue of when overnight parenting time will commence for Scarlett, and
how quickly Scarlett’s schedule will fully align with her older sister.
8                   
So in relation to Scarlett, both parents acknowledge the father
should have full alternate weekends no later than May 2025.  But they’re
spending thousands of dollars on lawyers to angrily debate what should happen
during the handful of months between now and then.
9                   
The following chart summarizes their positions in relation to the
father’s time with Scarlett:
10               
The applicable law is set out in the Divorce Act which
encourages a child-focused approach:
11               
Parenting orders are fact specific.  Each case turns on its own
unique circumstances.  Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] S.C.J. No.
52 (S.C.C.); N.S. v. A.N.S. 2021 ONSC 5283 (SCJ).  The court’s
function is not to pronounce on what is in the best interest for all children
in a general sense, but rather what is in the best interests of the child
before the court.  Deschenes v. Medwayosh, 2016 ONCJ
567 (OCJ);  A.P. v. P.P., 2021 ONSC 6540 (SCJ).
12               
There is no reason that a
young child cannot have more than two parental figures in their life, to love,
guide and nurture the child.  Jacobs & Coulombe v. Blair & Amyotte,
2022 ONSC 3159 (SCJ).
13               
Section 16(1) of
the Divorce Act provides that the court shall take into
consideration only the best interests of a child when making a parenting order
or a contact order.
14               
Section 16(2) says when
considering best interests factors, primary consideration is to be given to the
child’s physical, emotional and psychological safety, security and
well-being.  Pierre v. Pierre, 2021 ONSC 5650 (SCJ); Churchill
v. Elliot and Ward, 2024 ONSC 1907 (SCJ).
15               
It is also in a child’s best
interests when making a parenting order that his or her caregiver be physically
and emotionally safe.  Q.M.S.Q. v. S.Q. 2021 ONCJ 334 (OCJ); N.S. v.
A.N.S. 2021 ONSC 5283 (SCJ).
16               
Section 16(3) sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors related to
the circumstances of the child, which the court must consider in determining
the best interests of the child.
17               
The court is required to undertake a broad analysis of each
child’s specific situation.
18               
The Divorce Act imposes several important duties on parents, which are aimed at
ensuring that their parenting remains focussed on the child's best interests; that children are safeguarded against unnecessary conflict; and that parenting issues are addressed in an orderly
manner, with all relevant information being provided to the court. Section 7.1
requires them to keep the best interests of the child at the forefront of their
minds at all times. M.A.B. v. M.G.C.  2022 ONSC 7207 (SCJ).
19               
In Barendregt v.
Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22 (SCC) the Supreme Court of Canada summarized
the enormous challenge family courts face when dealing with children issues:
20               
In determining the best interests of a child, section 16(3)(j)
mandates that the court must specifically consider whether there has been any
family violence, and the impact of that violence on the child (and on the
ability and willingness of any parties to care for and meet the needs of the
child).
21               
Section 16(5) sets out that past parental conduct is only
relevant to the determination of a parenting order if it relates to the ability
to meet the needs of the child.  Ivory v. Ivory 2021 ONSC 5475 (SCJ).
22               
Parental conduct, however
meritorious or reprehensible, does not enter into the analysis unless it
relates to the ability of the parent to meet the needs of the child.  S.K.
v. D.P.,2022 ONSC 2359 (SCJ); B.M. v. D.M.  2023 ONSC 2068 (SCJ).
23               
However, misconduct which
results in parents having a negative view or attitude toward one another may be
relevant if it affects the emotional well-being of a child.  S.S.L. v. M.A.B.,
2022 ONSC 6326 (SCJ); B.M. v. D.M.  2023 ONSC 2068 (SCJ).
24               
Few family court cases are
free of painful memories and experiences. And it is entirely understandable
that people in crisis – particularly immediately after separation – will
perceive that family court is both an appropriate and welcome forum to tell the
world what happened.  What their ex did.
25               
Section 16(5) reflects the
court’s endless struggle to discourage needlessly hurtful and destructive
behaviour between parents who will still have to interact with one another long
after the court case is over.  In E.M.B. v. M.F.B. 2021 ONSC 4264 (SCJ)
Justice Mandane offered some important guidance:
26               
Section 7.2 of the Divorce Act addresses the importance
of the parties protecting children from conflict related to the ongoing court
case. It sets out that a party to a proceeding under this Part shall, to the
best of the party’s ability, protect any child from conflict arising from the
proceeding.
27               
A party’s failure to protect a child from conflict may be an
important consideration in granting primary residence and decision-making
responsibility to the other parent. Wiafe v. Aboakwa-Yeboah, 2021 ONCJ
201 (OCJ).
28               
If parties are unable to safeguard children from conflict, the
court must take matters into its own hands by uncovering and exposing the
sources of the conflict and imposing terms targeted at eliminating those
causes.  M.A.B. v. M.G.C.  2022 ONSC 7207 (SCJ).  As this court urged in
K.M. v. J.R., 2022 ONSC 111:
29               
Section 16(3)(i) of the Divorce Act requires the court
to consider “the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the
order would apply to communicate and cooperate, in particular with one another,
on matters affecting the child”.
30               
Subject to concerns about family violence, each
parent has a responsibility to support a child’s relationship with the other
parent, and to take steps to ensure that the child has a positive attitude
about that relationship. Moreira v. Garcia Dominguez 2012 ONCJ 128 (OCJ).
31               
The obligation is not merely
passive. A primary resident parent must not just accommodate the other parent’s
time with the child – they must facilitate and encourage it. Scrivo
v. Scrivo, 2012 CarswellOnt 5545; Tran v. Chen, 2012 CarswellOnt 8551
(SCJ).
32               
If one parent does not facilitate a child's relationship with the
other parent -- or undermines the child's relationship with the other parent
--  it will be a relevant factor in determining the person's ability to act as
a parent.  This is a “best interests” factor pursuant to s.16(3)(c)
s.24(3)(c). Leggatt v Leggatt, 2015 ONSC 4502 (SCJ); B.L.O. v.
L.J.B. 2022 ONCJ 231 (OCJ)
33               
The comparative ability or inclination to encourage a relationship
with the other parent may become a more prominent – or even determinant –
factor in crafting a parenting order, where the parents are otherwise equally
qualified. Moreira v. Garcia Dominguez 2012 ONCJ 128 (OCJ).
34               
Pursuant to section 16(6) of the Divorce Act courts
allocating parenting time are required to adhere to the principle that “a child
should have as much time with each spouse as is consistent with the best
interests of the child”.  Knapp v. Knapp, 2021 ONCA 305 (ON CA); O'Brien
v. Chuluunbaatar 2021 ONCA 555 (ON CA).
35               
Without question, the young ages of these two children – 22 months
and 6 months – are an important and complex dynamic:
36               
There is no “tender years doctrine” precluding very young children
from being equally parented by their fathers.  Young
v. Young; Karimi v. Kyron, 2022 ONSC 3252 (SCJ).
37               
Young children with attachments to both parents need sufficient
contact with both parents without prolonged separations to maintain a
meaningful and close relationship with both: Wilson v. Wilson, 2015
ONSC 479 (SCJ); Morrison v. Harder 2021 ONSC 5107 (SCJ).
38               
The right of a child to have meaningful contact with both parents,
and to know and maintain (or form) an attachment to each parent is a
fundamental right and should only be interfered with in the most extreme and
unusual circumstances – generally, only in demonstrated circumstances of danger
to the child’s physical or mental well-being. Ferreira v Ferreira, 2015
ONSC 3602 (SCJ); De Souza v. De Souza, 2023 ONSC 2457 (SCJ)
39               
The biggest single issue fueling this litigation is overnight
parenting time for the father.
40               
There is increasing recognition that overnight parenting time is
not only feasible but actually quite beneficial and important for young
children.  Rajani v. Rajani, 2021 ONSC 4784 (SCJ); Burley v. Bradley,
2019 ONCJ 624 (OCJ); H. v. A. 2022 ONSC 1560 (SCJ).
41               
The subject matter of this interim dispute between these parents
is not uncommon, although the level of animosity and aggressiveness is starting
to border on the exceptional.
42               
Typically, on an interim motion the court is presented with
hastily prepared, conflicting affidavits which are incomplete and untested. 
The facts are often still evolving.  As a result, a temporary order is meant to
provide a reasonably acceptable solution on an expeditious basis for a problem
that will be fully canvassed at subsequent conferences or resolved at a
trial.  Coe v. Tope, 2014 ONSC 4002 (SCJ); Munroe v.
Graham, 2021 ONCJ 253 (SCJ); Nicholson v. Nicholson, 2021 ONSC
7045 (SCJ); Sadiq v
Musa, 2023 ONSC
1811 (SCJ); Grover v Grover, 2023 ONSC 3607 (SCJ); Churchill
v. Elliot and Ward, 2024 ONSC 1907 (SCJ)
43               
In this case, the mother and father are each convinced that their
plan will be good for the children while the opposing plan will be bad
for the children. But in reality, consideration of parenting plans need not be
limited to a binary choice.
44               
Here, the real issue is not “6 overnights out of 14” vs. “7
overnights out of 14”.
45               
The real issue is not “6:30 p.m. return time” vs. “7:00 p.m.
return time.”
46               
The real issue is not overnights starting in December vs. January
vs. February vs. March.
47               
Resolving specific details like this are obviously necessary.
48               
But the details aren’t nearly as important as the amount of
fighting the parents are doing over those details.
49               
If these two parents were capable of behaving in a respectful,
mature, child-focused, encouraging manner, then both of these children would
thrive and be happy in any of the proposals under consideration.
50               
Each party referred to Association of Family and Conciliation
Courts (AFCC-Ontario) Parenting Plan Guide in relation to both children.
51               
I have explained why I don’t believe any change to Chloe’s
schedule is appropriate at this time.
52               
With respect to Scarlett, the parties agree it is appropriate to
work toward implementation of overnights. I am mindful of the child’s age. I
find that overnights should commence soon, but not quite as soon as the father
proposes.
53               
Finally, one of the more difficult challenges on this file is not
the exact parenting schedule, but rather the location for parenting exchanges.
54               
This is where the parents are both going to have to grow up. And
quickly.
55               
Temporary order:
56               
In relation to the child Chloe, the father shall have parenting
time:
57               
In relation to the child Scarlett, the father shall have parenting
time:
58               
Exchanges shall take place at a neutral setting like a daycare
facility, if the child would otherwise be at that facility.  Otherwise
exchanges shall take place at the mother’s residence.  The mother shall ensure
that the maternal grandfather is not present and does not involve himself in
any exchanges. Both parties shall ensure that exchanges are brief, civil and
uneventful.
59               
In the event that any future problems arise in relation to
parenting exchanges, the matter may be returned to court by motion on short
notice, preferably to my attention (although I am not seized).  In the event
that either party brings a motion alleging problems with respect to exchanges
at the mother’s residence, both parties shall include in their materials a
comprehensive proposal for the utilization of institutional supervision of
exchanges, with the cost to be presumptively shared equally between the
parties.  In that event, the parenting schedule may have to be changed to
accommodate the availability of institutional supervisors.
60               
At the close of submissions, I suggested to the parties that their
money and energy would be much better spent pursuing less adversarial and more
therapeutic solutions. These are very young children, and at the rate things
are escalating, the parents are going to run out of money, and the court system
is going to run out of patience.
61               
I would urge the parties to resolve the issue of costs,
particularly having regard to Rules 24(6) (“divided success”) and 24(4)
(“successful party who has behaved unreasonably”).
62               
If costs need to be addressed, written submissions (no more than
two pages long, excluding offers, with hyperlinks to case law) are to be served
and filed on the following deadlines:
