On January 3, 2025, I dismissed a motion to set
aside the default judgment for foreclosure and the noting in default of the
Defendant/Moving Party, Eric Manirambona. I was advised by the parties that
Ural Link Ltd. played no part in the motion. My Reasons for Decision on Costs
do not apply to Ural Link Ltd.
[2]              
At the conclusion of my Reasons for Decision, regarding
the issue of costs, I stated:
[3]              
The Plaintiff/Responding Party’s Cost Submissions
were served and filed on January 17, 2025. The Defendant/Moving Party had until
January 31, 2025, to serve and file their Cost Submissions. No Cost Submissions
have been received from the Defendant/Moving Party. In the circumstances, I
conclude that it is appropriate to determine costs at this time.
[4]              
The Plaintiff/Responding Party now seeks costs
on a substantial indemnity basis.
[5]              
The issues before me are as follows:
[6]              
For the following reasons, I have concluded that
costs should be payable forthwith on a substantial indemnity basis by the Defendant/Moving
Party to the Plaintiff/Responding Party. I fix costs payable to the Plaintiff/Responding
Party in the amount of $28,000.00, including fees, disbursements, and HST,
payable forthwith.
[7]              
The Plaintiff/Responding Party submits that the following
factors militate in favour of an elevated costs award:
[8]              
Regarding quantum, the Plaintiff/Responding
Party seeks $28,000.00, all-inclusive. This is based on both the principle of
indemnity and the fact that these were costs that the unsuccessful party could
reasonably expect to pay.  The Plaintiff/Responding Party points to the
Defendant/Moving Party’s Costs Outline for support for this position.
[9]              
The Defendant/Moving Party has provided no Cost
Submissions.
[10]          
Elevated costs may be warranted where the
unsuccessful party has engaged in behaviour worthy of sanction.
[11]          
Where a party has engaged in reprehensible,
scandalous, or outrageous conduct, a court may sanction this conduct through an
award of elevated costs: Davies v. Clarington (Municipality), 2009 ONCA
722, at para. 28; Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 134.
Substantial indemnity costs are to be awarded “in rare and exceptional cases to
mark the court’s disapproval of the conduct of the party in the litigation”: Hunt
v. TD Securities Inc. (2003), 2003 CanLII 3649 (ON CA), 66 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 123.
[12]          
In my view, the conduct of the Defendant/Moving
Party is worthy of judicial rebuke and ought to trigger an elevated costs award.
[13]          
The Defendant/Moving Party intentionally and
inappropriately delayed the legal process—depriving the Plaintiff/Responding
Party of the rights and entitlements that flowed from the judgment signed more
than 18 months ago.
[14]          
Moreover, I rejected numerous factual assertions
by the Defendant/Moving Party regarding his belief/state of mind regarding his obligations.
These are outlined in the Plaintiff/Responding Party’s Cost Submissions in
paragraph 3.
[15]          
The Defendant/Moving Party rejected a very
reasonable offer to settle when there was little realistic chance of success,
thereby necessitating the litigation of the motion, which was itself delayed.
[16]          
I conclude that costs should be awarded on a substantial
indemnity basis.
[17]          
The costs fixed by the court “should reflect
more what the court views as a fair and reasonable amount that should be paid
by the unsuccessful parties rather than any exact measure of the actual costs
to the successful litigant”: Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the
Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.) (“Boucher”), at
para. 24.
[18]          
The Plaintiff/Responding Party was entirely successful on the motion and
is presumptively entitled to his costs.
[19]          
The motion was critically important to the Plaintiff/Responding
Party.  He was owed over $400,000, including considerable amounts spent on
improving the property. It was important for the Plaintiff/Responding Party to
defend his investment of time, effort and money.
[20]          
I find that the rates claimed for counsel for the Plaintiff/Responding
Party are reasonable, considering his years of experience. I similarly find the
disbursements claimed by the Plaintiff/Responding Party were properly incurred.
[21]          
For these reasons, the Plaintiff/Responding Party is entitled to costs
on a substantial indemnity basis. In all the circumstances and having regard to
the principles enunciated in Boucher and the factors listed in r. 57.01
of the Rules of Civil Procedure, I find that the fees and disbursements
claimed by the Plaintiff/Responding Party on the present motion are fair and
reasonable. Costs are to be paid by the Defendant/Moving Party, Eric
Manirambona in the total amount of $28,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and
taxes, forthwith.
