[1]               The accused in this matter, A.M. pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code.[1]
[2]               The court must now sentence A.M.
[3]               The victim indicated that the assaults started at the end of June 2022 when she was 11 years old.  A.M. entered her bedroom, removed her clothing and placed his finger inside her vagina.  The next occasion occurred during the Canada Day weekend.  The victim had some friends over and after they left, A.M. again entered her bedroom, removed her pants and penetrated the victim’s vagina with his finger.  The victim experienced pain after this incident.  There were several more similar incidents that occurred in the victim’s bedroom.  On one occasion, A.M. commented that the victim had ‘a beautiful vagina’.  There was a further occasion in late 2022 when the victim was at home sick and A.M. sat with her on the couch and penetrated her vagina with his finger under her pants.  Later that day, he once again entered her bedroom and sexually assaulted in the same fashion as previously.
[4]               In November 2022, the victim told several school friends what had been happening to her.  They, in turn, told their parents.  The Children’s Aid Society was contacted as well as the police.
[5]               A.M. turned himself in on December 2, 2022.  He was charged with this offence and in March 2024, he pleaded guilty.  A pre-sentence report and sexual behaviour assessment was ordered.
[6]               A.M. was born and grew up in Poland.  He was married in Poland but his wife died tragically of pancreatic cancer.  As a result, he decided to immigrate to Canada and start over.  He married a second time, but that marriage ended 10 years later.  A.M. has two children from that marriage who he was seeing regularly until he was charged with this offence.
[7]               In 2018, A.M. started a relationship with the mother of the victim.  M.C. and her two children moved in with A.M. in 2019.  According to the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report, both A.M. and M.C. described their relationship in positive terms.
[8]               A.M. is presently 55 years old.  He is a registered nurse practitioner, and he has worked consistently in that field since his arrival in Canada.  Shortly before the sentencing hearing he retired from his job.
[9]               A.M. has no prior criminal record.
[10]           As noted at the outset, A.M. pleaded guilty to this charge.  He expressed remorse to both the probation officer and to Dr. Gulati, who prepared a s. 21 Mental Health Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7 sexual behaviours report.  In court, he apologized to the victim and her family and took full responsibility for his actions.
[11]           The probation officer noted that A.M.,
[12]           Dr. Gulati indicated that when asked about the offence, A.M. stated, “I admit to all aspects of the alleged offence” and that when asked about responsibility, he said, “I accept full responsibility”.  In addition, A.M. said “I know this is wrong.  It is just idiocy, I know this is not right and not normal.  I feel so bad that I would have caused [L.] this pain”[3]  However, Dr. Gulati also noted that,
[13]           The probation officer spoke to A.M.’s second wife, his mother and M.C.  M.C. indicated that when she confronted A.M. with the allegations, he denied them.  According to S.M. he also denied committing the offence. E.R. – A.M.’s mother – indicated that he made a partial admission to her.
[14]           The victim, her brother and M.C. prepared victim impact statements.  They each recounted the devastating impact that these incidents have had on the family.
[15]           The victim’s brother stated,” I’ve … had nights of just wondering what I could have done to stop what he was doing or to help [my sister]. … And not all of his actions just affected me emotionally, they impacted my sense of safety and security.”
[16]           M.C. indicated, “I have had many sleepless nights ever since I’ve been informed of the situation. … what I think about on these nights [is] about how I wish that it was me who was hurt and not my daughter.  I hate that I have to watch her suffer…”
[17]           Finally, the victim said,
[18]            According to the victim, she has been diagnosed with depression and she is taking medication.
[19]           Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the governing principles of sentencing. That section states:
[20]           In a case involving sexual assault, the primary sentencing principles are denunciation and deterrence.
[21]           There are two aspects to the principle of deterrence; they are general deterrence and specific deterrence. Specific deterrence relates to the offender himself and aims to deter that offender from re‑offending. General deterrence relates to the belief that an appropriate sentence will have the effect of deterring other members of the public from committing similar offences. In this case, both specific and general deterrence are applicable.
[22]           Two other sentencing principles set out in the Criminal Code have a significant impact on this sentencing hearing. Section 718.1 states:
[23]           In addition, s. 718.2(d) points out that, ‘an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances.’  This principle is known as the principle of restraint.
[24]           In this case, both counsel agree that a custodial sentence is appropriate; they disagree on how long.
[25]           It must be noted that the sentencing ranges for sexual offences have changed over time.  The courts have come to recognize as stated in R. v. Friesen[6] that there needs to be more emphasis on factors other than the specific nature of the sexual offence.  Therefore,
[26]           This view is especially important where the offence involves a young and vulnerable victim as it does in the present case.  The age of the victim is an critical factor in determining an appropriate sentence.  In Friesen, the court noted that,
[27]           In the present case, given A.M. did not have a criminal record before being found guilty of this offence, rehabilitation is also a principle that is applicable.
[28]           In Friesen, the Court set out a list of factors relevant to determining a fit sentence of persons who commit sexual offences against children.  These factors are;
[29]           In addition to the principles to be applied to sentencing the court must also consider any mitigating or aggravating factors.
[30]           The Crown argues that the following aggravating factors should be considered:
[31]           The Crown also noted that there are two mitigating factors that the court should consider.  First, A.M. has no criminal and second, and most importantly, he pleaded guilty.  Neither the victim, nor any member of her family was required to testify in court.
[32]           Defence counsel agrees essentially with the aggravating and mitigating factors as set out by the Crown.
[33]           Crown counsel is seeking a sentence of four years in the penitentiary along with several ancillary orders.  The Crown provided the court with examples of sentences that bear some resemblance to the present situation.  Those sentences vary between two to six years.
[34]           Defence counsel argues that a two-year sentence is more appropriate in the circumstances and suggests that sentence should be followed by a period of probation.  He does not oppose the ancillary orders requested by the Crown.  Defence counsel also provided a several cases with sentences that varied between two and three years.
[35]           The exercise of sentencing an offender requires the balancing of all the factors relevant to the particular situation.
[36]           In the present case, as noted earlier, denunciation and deterrence are the primary factors to be considered.  In addition, several of the factors set out in R. v. Friesen are relevant to the present case.
[37]           In my view, the primary factors that are relevant to the present case are:
[38]           Crown counsel asked the court to discount the effect of the acceptance of responsibility because A.M. denied committing the offence to S.M. or M.C. and he had taken only partial responsibility when discussing the matter with his mother.
[39]           I agree with Defence counsel that in the absence of any context for the discussion with S.M. and E.R., it is difficult to place much weight on A.M.’s response.  With respect to his denial to M.C., it occurred immediately after she confronted him with the allegations.  Such a response would not be unexpected.  Of much more importance is the fact that after reflection, he decided to take responsibility and plead guilty.
[40]           Dr. Gulati concluded after significant testing that A.M. was at a low risk to reoffend.  This factor is directly relevant to specific deterrence and in the context of this case, that factor is consequently of less importance.  However, it nonetheless should be considered in determining the appropriate length of sentence.
[41]           Other factors to be weighed in the balance are:
[42]           After considering all of these factors, and reviewing the case law provided by counsel, I have concluded that a sentence of three years jail is appropriate in all of the circumstances.
[43]           In addition, there will be the following ancillary orders:
