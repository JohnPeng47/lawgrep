[1]          Ametra
Dave filed an assignment in bankruptcy and A. Farber & Partners Inc. was
appointed as trustee in bankruptcy.
[2]          The
Trustee has completed its administration of the bankruptcy estate. As required
by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Trustee prepared a final
statement of receipts and disbursements, provided it for review to the Office
of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy (who had no comment), and had it taxed by
Associate Justice Ilchenko.
[3]          Linda
Zaplotinsky, a creditor of Ms. Dave, objected to the statement. As a result, a
hearing was held to determine whether the statement should be approved without
amendment, or whether the fees and disbursements of the Trustee and its legal
counsel should be reduced due to the concerns raised by Ms. Zaplotinsky.
[4]          Ms.
Zaplotinsky argues that the fees and disbursements of the Trustee and its legal
counsel, Jaffe & Peritz LLP (“Counsel”), should be reduced from $195,826.36
to $17,850 because, among other things: (a) the Trustee did not administer the
assets in the bankruptcy estate in a reasonable and competent manner; (b) legal
proceedings brought by the Trustee were ill timed and unnecessary; (c) the
Trustee did not act in the best interests of the unsecured creditors; and (d)
the Trustee and Counsel incurred unnecessary legal and administrative costs
that depleted the assets in the bankruptcy estate.
[5]          The
Trustee argues that Ms. Zaplotinsky’s objections are without merit. It believes
that it always acted in a commercially reasonable manner, and that all time
spent by the Trustee and Counsel was legitimate and necessary for the
administration of the bankruptcy estate. It believes that the bankruptcy was a
complicated matter, as it involved an opposed discharge from bankruptcy, two
occupied residential properties to be realized upon, numerous court
attendances, and dealings with the active engagement of multiple creditors.
[6]          For the
reasons set out below, I exercise my discretion to reduce the fees of the
Trustee by $10,000 and the fees of Counsel by $9,123.
[7]          For this
motion, John Delo, a representative of the Trustee, and Brandon Jaffe have
sworn affidavits in support of the approval of the final statement of receipts
and disbursements. Each of the affidavits contain detailed breakdowns of the
time spent by the Trustee and Counsel. Neither of them was cross-examined on
their affidavit.[1]
[8]          The
Trustee also relies on its motion record dated February 11, 2021 and its reply
motion record dated April 22, 2021 with respect to a proposed sale of the
Winterton Property (as defined below), as well as the motion record of Ms. Dave
dated June 25, 2021 in connection with a motion to set aside default judgment,
and the Trustee’s case conference brief of documents dated November 16, 2023.
[9]          Ms.
Zaplotinsky swore affidavits on February 26, March 19, and July 17, 2023 with
respect to this motion. The Trustee argues that the July 17, 2023 affidavit
should not be relied on, as it was served outside of the timetable established
by Associate Justice Ilchenko. Ms. Zaplotinsky was cross-examined on August 30,
2023.
[10]      Ms. Zaplotinsky also relies on her
Notice of Objection dated September 13, 2022, along with her affidavit sworn
March 2, 2021 in response to the Trustee’s sale approval motion for the
Winterton Property.
[11]      All in all, the parties have
uploaded more than 2,100 pages of evidence to Case Centre for this motion.
Neither party filed a compendium.
[12]      On March 14, 2017, Ms. Dave filed
an assignment in bankruptcy and Farbers was appointed as Trustee.
[13]      The Trustee’s final statement of
receipts and disbursements dated April 9, 2022 (the “R&D Statement”)
lists $238,024.81 in receipts and $195,826.36 in disbursements.
[14]      The amount available for
distribution to unsecured creditors, after application of the statutory levy,[2]
is $40,088.53. There was proven unsecured claims totaling $1,174,977.92 in the
bankruptcy estate, which would result in a dividend of approximately 3.4 cents
on the dollar for unsecured creditors.
[15]      The largest receipt is $220,125
from the sale of a single detached home municipally known as 576 Winterton Way,
Mississauga (the “Winterton Property”). Ms. Dave jointly owned the
Winterton Property with her spouse, Deeneshwar Bissessar. They occupied the
property with their 7-year-old child as at the time of bankruptcy.
[16]      The disbursements are primarily
made up of the Trustee’s fees of $65,255.81 (inclusive of HST), and the
Trustee’s legal fees of $105,269.40 (inclusive of HST). The legal fees consist
of a bill of costs of Counsel in the amount of $101,048.01 (all inclusive), and
three bills of costs from Rubenstein, Siegel totaling $4,221.39 (all
inclusive), all of which have been taxed by Associate Justice Ilchenko.[3]
[17]      Ms. Zaplotinsky’s proven unsecured
claim is $605,556.61. It is with respect to the default judgment granted by
Justice Lemon on June 15, 2015. Ms. Zaplotinsky’s claim represents 51.54% of
all proven unsecured claims.
[18]      The principles set out below are derived from cases dealing with the
approval of the fees and disbursements of Court-appointed receivers and
monitors under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act. In my view,
such principles are equally applicable to a trustee in bankruptcy.[4]
[19]      The onus is on a trustee to prove that the compensation for which it
seeks approval of, including the compensation claimed on behalf of its counsel,
is fair and reasonable.[5]
However, it would be inappropriate to reduce the fees of court officers based
on the suggestion that they are “too high” without some specific principled
objection.[6]
[20]      A trustee and its counsel must provide accounts
that disclose in detail the name of each person who rendered services, the
dates on which the services were rendered, the time expended each day, the rate
charged and the total charges for each category of services rendered.[7]
[21]      The accounts should be in a form that can be easily
understood by those affected by the bankruptcy (or by the judicial officer
required to assess the accounts) so that such person can determine the amount
of time spent by the trustee’s employees (and others that the trustee may have
hired) in respect to the various discrete aspects of the bankruptcy proceeding.[8]
[22]      The trustee’s accounts and its counsel’s accounts must be
verified by an affidavit. This ensures the truthfulness of the time spent by
the trustee and its counsel in carrying out their duties, as well as the
disbursements they incurred. It also provides an opportunity to
cross-examine the affiant if any interested party objects to the amount claimed
by the trustee or its counsel for fees and disbursements.[9]
[23]      It is not necessary for each person that docketed time to
swear that they recorded their dockets accurately. The
accounts of a trustee are electronic business records made in the ordinary
course of business and are admissible as prima facie evidence of the
facts stated in them.[10]
[24]      A registrar in bankruptcy has “a wide discretion to set the
appropriate amount of a trustee’s fees. There is no dispute that this includes
the authority to reduce a trustee’s fees for specific acts of misconduct that
have cost the estate quantifiable amounts …it is also within the jurisdiction
of the registrar to reduce a trustee’s fees further in appropriate cases.”[11]
[25]      A registrar may also reduce fees where the trustee has not fulfilled
its statutory duties, or if the integrity of the bankruptcy system is
undermined (even where the maladministration of the bankruptcy estate does not
result in identifiable prejudice to the estate).[12]
[26]      Any reduction in fees is not
intended to be a fine or penalty and should be proportionate to the gravity and
nature of the dilatory conduct of the trustee in administering the estate.[13]
[27]      Fairness and reasonableness of the fees of a trustee and its counsel
are the lynchpins of the analysis to be undertaken by the Court.[14] The focus of the fair and reasonable assessment should be
on what was accomplished, not on how much time it took.[15]
[28]      The following are the general principles to be considered by the
Court when determining a trustee’s fees:
[29]      Additionally, the following factors are applicable to a review of a trustee’s
compensation, and are to serve as a useful guideline but are not to be
considered as exhaustive:
[30]      I have organized my analysis to
correspond to the specific objections Ms. Zaplotinsky has raised concerning the
activities of the Trustee and Counsel.
[31]        Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that the
optimal time for the Trustee to sell the Winterton Property was in 2017, when
the property was allegedly worth $1,400,000. She claims that by failing to sell
the Winterton Property until November 2021, the Trustee acted to the detriment
of the unsecured creditors.
[32]      She says that her counsel, Frederick
Hawa, made several requests for the Trustee to sell the Winterton Property in a
timely manner. She believes that there would have been at least $500,000 in
equity in the property if it had been sold earlier, which would have resulted
in $250,000 coming into the bankruptcy estate. Ms. Zaplotinsky also alleges
that the 4.5-year delay in selling the Winterton Property resulted in between $250,000
to $300,000 of interest accumulating to the mortgagees.
[33]      I do not accept these submissions,
as the evidence before the Court does not support them.
[34]      With respect to the value of the
Winterton Property, the Trustee obtained an opinion of value from Royal LePage dated
July 3, 2017, that listed the Winterton Property as having an estimated value
between $880,000 to $920,000. Ms. Zaplotinsky has not put forth any evidence in
support of her claim that the market value of the Winterton Property in 2017
was $1,400,000, outside of some mostly unreadable printouts from an unnamed Mississauga
website. She confirmed during cross-examination that she did not obtain any
appraisals in 2017, 2018 or 2019.
[35]      With respect to the claims against
the Winterton Property, as of the date of bankruptcy, it was subject to a total
of $926,367.90 in secured claims based on the proofs of claim filed by: (a)
Bank of Montreal as first mortgagee in the amount of $509,069.10; (b) The
Canada Trust Company as second mortgagee in the amount of $259,115.75;[18]
(c) Our Exito Inc. as third mortgagee in the amount of $107,557.67;[19]
and (d) Canada Revenue Agency with respect to two liens registered in the
collective amount of $97,565.05 for director’s liability under the Income
Tax Act, principal, and interest.
[36]      As detailed below, the value of
the Winterton Property was determined to be $1,410,000 for the sale transaction
that closed in November 2021. The total amount of the encumbrances against the
Winterton Property had increased by $56,511.91.[20]
The amount owed to the three mortgagees had increased by $154,076.96,[21]
but the amount owed to CRA had been repaid from the sale of another property
owned by Ms. Dave.
[37]      Additionally, Ms. Dave, Mr.
Bissessar, and their son were living at the Winterton Property. There may have
been other family members living at the property as well, and potentially
basement tenants. The Trustee would have been required to bring a partition and
sale application, and obtain orders for possession and a writ of possession.
That would have required the Trustee to expend significant time and resources.
[38]      Based on the value of the
Winterton Property, the encumbrances on title and the cost to enforce, it was
not unreasonable for the Trustee to take no steps to realize on the property in
2017, since it appeared to have no equity available for the bankruptcy estate. Additionally,
the amount owed to the mortgagees did not increase between $250,000 to $300,000
by the time the property was sold, as claimed by Ms. Zaplotinsky, and the value
of the property increased by close to $500,000 by 2021.
[39]      As a result, I find that there is
no issue with respect to the Trustee’s conduct to warrant any reduction in its
fees.
[40]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that the
Trustee brought or was involved in legal proceedings that were ill-timed and
unnecessary, and resulted in a depletion of the assets in the estate.
[41]      The Trustee retained Counsel in April
2019 to provide legal advice with respect to realizing upon the Winterton
Property and the other property owned by Ms. Dave.
[42]       The Trustee served a motion
record in February 2021 seeking court approval of a sale of Ms. Dave’s 50%
interest in the Winterton Property for $50,000. The Trustee had offered the
property for sale to Ms. Dave, Mr. Bissessar, and Ms. Zaplotinsky. The only
offer received was from Ms. Dave, who assigned the offer to Mr. Bissessar.
[43]      Ms. Zaplotinsky opposed the
motion, arguing that the Winterton Property was worth more than what the
Trustee had valued it at. She also argued that a sale of the property on the
open market was preferred.
[44]      Pursuant to the Endorsement of
Justice Koehnen dated May 4, 2021, the Court dismissed the motion on the basis
that Trustee’s efforts to sell the Winterton Property did not comply with the Soundair
principles. Justice Koehnen held that the Winterton Property should have
been marketed to the public and the Trustee should have considered a partition
and sale application.
[45]      Justice Koehnen’s decision was not
appealed by any party.
[46]      Pursuant to an Endorsement dated
May 12, 2021, Justice Koehnen fixed costs of $10,343.96 payable by the Trustee
to Ms. Zaplotinsky and $12,422.94 payable to another creditor that opposed the
motion.
[47]      The Trustee’s costs outline for
the motion claimed $16,917 plus HST on a partial indemnity basis. The actual
costs amount was $26,040 plus HST, with 70.9 hours of time.
[48]      Counsel has reduced its bill of
costs by $16,917. He was not ordered to do so by Justice Koehnen. There was no
direction from the Court that the Trustee could not seek reimbursement of its
legal fees from the bankruptcy estate even though it was unsuccessful on the
motion.
[49]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that this
reduction does not go far enough, as Counsel spent more time on the motion that
is not accounted for.
[50]      I accept the submissions of Ms. Zaplotinsky
on this point. I note that the $16,917 amount was the partial indemnity amount that
the Trustee would have sought if it was successful on the motion. The actual
amount in the costs outline was $26,040, an increase of $9,123.
[51]      In my view, given that Justice
Koehnen held that the Trustee had failed to satisfy him that it conducted a
sales process in accordance with the Soundair principles, and given that
payment of over $22,000 in legal fees for counsel to creditors has already come
out of the estate, it would be unfair for estate to bear the burden of the
Trustee’s and Counsel’s fees for the motion.
[52]      As a result, Counsel’s account
should be further reduced by $9,123.
[53]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that Counsel
spent far more than $26,040 in connection with bringing the motion. She says
that the actual fees charged for the time that was said to be removed was over
$36,500.
[54]      I have reviewed Counsel’s dockets.
There is time devoted to considering issues with respect to the tender process that
were not covered by the reduction. As well, when comparing the Costs Outline of
the Trustee and Counsel’s invoice, it appears that the time and docket entries
do not match each other.
[55]      However, in my view, there was time
charged that was necessary for the Trustee to consider realizing upon the
Winterton Property for the benefit of the estate. I do not think that Justice
Koenhen’s dismissal of the Trustee’s motion requires there to be a total elimination
of any time spent with respect to the tender process.
[56]      I find that the existing reduction
of $16,917, and additional reduction of Counsel’s fees by $9,123, is fair and
reasonable in the circumstances.
[57]      Ms. Zaplotinsky also argues that
the Trustee should have reduced its fees by $12,930 on account of time spent
with respect to the failed tender process. I have reviewed the dockets of the
Trustee and, for the same reasons set out in paragraph 51 above, find that it
is necessary to reduce the fees charged by the Trustee with respect to bringing
the unsuccessful motion.
[58]      Having reviewed the time spent by
the Trustee, I believe that it is fair and reasonable to reduce the Trustee’s
fees by $10,000, as the estate should not have to further bear the costs of the
failed sale transaction.
[59]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that the
Trustee took the unnecessary step to prepare an application for partition and
sale, which resulted in an additional $8,032 of docketed time.
[60]      Pursuant to an Endorsement dated June
4, 2021, Justice Koehnen noted that the parties had agreed on a value of
$1,410,000 for the Winterton Property for the purposes of Mr. Bissessar’s
purchase of Ms. Dave’s interest in the property. Justice Koehnen held that Mr.
Bissessar had until July 5, 2021 to re-finance the property to purchase the
interest. If the purchase did not close by July 5, 2021, the Trustee “will
commence an application for partition and sale of the property”.
[61]      Mr. Bissessar was unable to close
by July 5, 2021. The Trustee agreed to an extension of the deadline. Notwithstanding
the agreed upon extension, the Trustee prepared an application for partition
and sale. The application also dealt with a request for an order compelling CRA
to discharge its liens against the Winterton Property.
[62]      On September 22, 2021, Justice
Penny granted an order approving the sale of Ms. Dave’s interest in the
Winterton Property to Mr. Bissessar for $206,000 plus costs of $10,000 plus HST
for a total purchase price of $217,300. The sale was to be completed by October
5, 2021, otherwise the order would have no force or effect.
[63]      The sale did not close by October
5, 2021. As a result, it was necessary for the parties to obtain a new sale
approval order from Justice Koehnen on November 9, 2021, which increased the
purchase price to $220,125. It required the sale to close by November 12, 2021.
The sale closed on that date.
[64]      The Trustee argues that it was
required to bring the application pursuant to Justice Koehnen’s June 4, 2024
endorsement. The order was obtained on consent to serve as a backstop in the
event the sale didn’t close, as noted by Justice Penny in his September 22,
2021 endorsement.
[65]      Given the language of Justice
Koehnen’s endorsement, the constant inability of Mr. Bissessar to meet the
deadlines, and the relief that the Trustee was seeking with respect to CRA, I
find that it was fair and reasonable for the Trustee and Counsel to incur the fees
they did to bring the application.
[66]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that the
Trustee and its counsel spent an inordinate amount of time on matters that
should have been dealt with by administrative staff to reduce fees. She points
to 11 hours of lawyer time to deal with a discharge of the CRA liens on the
Winterton Property, time spent by counsel to obtain discharge statements from
the mortgagees (which included spending over $3,800 in fees to obtain a
discharge from Malta Star), and the fact that the Trustee stopped communicating
with Mr. Hawa in 2019 and left all communications to be made by Counsel. Ms.
Zaplotinsky also takes issue with the amount of time spent communicating with
Ms. Dave’s lawyer.
[67]      Ms. Zaplotinsky also claims that
after November 2021, the Trustee and Counsel claim an additional $18,111 in
fees, even though after the sale closed all that was required was for the
Trustee to take steps to get the R&D statement approved and obtain its
discharge.
[68]      The Trustee argues that the issues
regarding CRA and Malta Star were more complicated than Ms. Zaplotinsky believes
them to be. The CRA was taking the position that the indebtedness owed to it
was not retired through payment from the sale of Ms. Dave’s other property. Malta
Star is domiciled in a different jurisdiction. The Trustee believes that the
time spent was necessary in the circumstances.
[69]      Again, I have reviewed the
accounts of the Trustee and Counsel. Based on the review, I do not see any
inefficiencies in the work performed by them. I understand the concern raised
by Ms. Zaplotinsky. However, matters do not occur in a vacuum. The fact that
obtaining discharges from mortgagees and CRA on other matters does not mean
that obtaining such discharges were not difficult in this situation. As well, it
was not unreasonable and inefficient for Counsel to be corresponding with
counsel to Ms. Dave, given the motion that was to be brought to challenge the
claim of the largest creditor in the estate (Ms. Zaplotinsky) and the
involvement in sale matters.
[70]      As a result, I find that the
conduct of the Trustee and Counsel was appropriate and reasonable in the
circumstances, and no reduction in their fees is warranted.
[71]      Ms. Zaplotinsky argues that the
following steps she took benefitted the bankruptcy estate and should be kept in
mind when considering the Trustee’s and Counsel’s fees and disbursements: (a) she
informed the Trustee of the existence of the Winterton Property; (b) she
informed the Trustee that the CRA’s lien had been repaid from the sale of the
other property owned by Ms. Dave; (c) she informed the Trustee and the Ontario
Securities Commission (“OSC”) that the OSC did not have a proper claim
as against Ms. Dave, which resulted in the OSC withdrawing its claim (even
after the Trustee had accepted it as a proven claim); and (d) she provided
information obtained from other proceedings that resulted in Mr. Bissessar’s
argument that the entire Winterton Property was held in trust for him could be
refuted.
[72]      I have kept these matters in mind
when assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the accounts of the Trustee
and Counsel.
[73]      Ms. Zaplotinsky noted that by the
end of November 2020, the Trustee and its counsel had incurred fees of
approximately $93,000 (inclusive of HST). At that time, the Trustee decided to
bring its motion to sell the interest in the Winterton Property for $50,000.
Based on proceeding down that route, the Trustee was prepared to take a
significant loss on its fees, more than $42,000.
[74]      I do not believe this fact assists
Ms. Zaplotinsky in her arguments. If the Trustee was of the view in the spring
of 2021 that a sale of the interest in the Winterton Property at $50,000 was in
the best interest of the estate, it had a duty to take steps to complete it,
even if it would have suffered a significant loss if the sale had been approved
and closed.
[75]      For the reasons set out below, I
have exercised my discretion to reduce the Trustee’s fees by $10,000 and
Counsel’s fees by $9,123.
[76]      With respect to costs, the parties
shall prepare written costs submissions no longer than 5 pages in length,
together with costs outlines, and serve them by November 26, 2024 (Trustee),
and by December 9, 2024 (Ms. Zaplotinsky). The submissions shall be emailed to
the Bankruptcy Court Office to my attention.
