This is an application brought by the Applicant
mother for a new child support order pursuant to ss. 9 and 16 of the Interjurisdictional
Support Orders Act, 2002, c. 13 (“ the ISO Act”).
[2]              
In her application filed on May 16, 2022, in
Maryland, United States, but only received in Ontario in March 2024, the mother
seeks child support for the parties’ child, Abdul-Shakur Wumpinin Yahuza, who
is 8 years old, retroactive to April 1, 2022.
[3]              
The parties were married on November 3, 2014, in
Maryland.  They separated in 2018 and they were divorced on September 21,
2018.  An amended Judgment of Absolute Divorce was signed by the Maryland Court
on June 4, 2019.  The divorce order grants the mother primary physical custody
and sole legal custody of the parties’ child, with access to the father.  It
does not deal with child support, and there is no prior child support order in
place for this child to the best of my knowledge.
[4]              
On April 16, 2024, the father disputed the
mother's Application.  In his Answer filed in the context of this proceeding,
the father alleges that the mother has made false statements in her application
and that she is currently residing in Ghana with the child, not in the United
States.  Additionally, he states that he made child support payments to the
mother over the years which should be set-off against any arrears.
[5]              
The information provided by the father to assess
his child support obligations back to April 2022 was incomplete and
insufficient. As a result, on May 2, the parties appeared before me virtually
for an initial case conference.  During that conference, I explained to the
parties the basic principles of child support, as those obligations are
determined in Ontario, and provided them with guidance on what the Court needed
to determine this issue.
[6]              
Thereafter, I made the following temporary
order:
[7]              
In June 2024, the father filed documents with
the Court in response to my directions for further information.  After some
delays which were not the responsibility of either party, the documents were
forwarded to the mother for her consideration and response.  On November 12,
the mother sent an email to the Family Court counter in which she provided a
response to the father’s additional evidence.  The mother was advised by the
Court counter staff that her response was unsworn and not in an admissible form,
and she was invited to submit her response in the form of a sworn affidavit.  She
then advised the court counter staff that she was looking forward to wrapping
this up and that the Court could render its decision based on the materials
previously filed.
[8]              
  This was particularly important since the
father alleged on the day he appeared before the Court that he was only earning
$13,000 per year, despite being the owner of a $605,000 home (with a $500,000
mortgage), having $17,000 in his bank account, and reporting $6,000 of net
monthly expenses in his financial statement.
[9]              
The father’s 2022 Notice of Assessment reveals a
total annual income of $86,124, and his 2023 Notice of Assessment confirms a
total annual income of $88,890.  In his sworn
financial statement, he indicates that he anticipates earning $69,000 this year
(2024).  Although the father did not provide an explanation as to why his
income in 2024 will be less than in the two previous years, he has provided pay
stubs which tend to support his estimated income for that year.  Also, I note
that the father’s income in 2021 was $68,315 and in 2020 it was $62,767.  I am
therefore prepared, based on that evidence, to set child support based on an
estimated 2024 income of $69,000.
[10]          
Based on the above, I make the following final
order:
