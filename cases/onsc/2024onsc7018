[1]              
This certified class proceeding, which was previously two proceedings,
is progressing towards a settlement approval hearing scheduled for February 4,
2024. Recently, I granted amendments to the statement of claim, consolidated
the two actions into one, certified it for purposes of settlement, and approved
the notice plan and proposed notices: Bonnick v. Krimker, 2024 ONSC 6331.
[2]              
The plaintiffs have now moved, on an unopposed basis, for an order
appointing Verita Global as the administrator for the implementation of the
proposed settlement of the proceeding.
[3]              
Class counsel undertook a request for proposals process to select the
class administrator best suited for this case. It identified three firms that
potentially had the capacity and experience to implement this settlement,
including Verita, and sought a proposal from them. Verita was among the
administrators that delivered a proposal, and delivered answers thereafter in
response to questions posed by class counsel.
[4]              
Class counsel is experienced. They have concluded that Verita’s proposal
best meets the requirements of an administrator in this settlement for reasons
including Verita’s experience in claims administration on a national level, its
ability to serve vulnerable individuals, the training of its staff, its ability
to communicate in English and in French, its ability to adequately report on
implementation, its proposed budget, and its certification regarding
cyber-security for the administration.
[5]              
I am satisfied that Class Counsel’s choice is appropriate. I approve
Verita as administrator.
[6]              
The order shall go in the form of the draft I have signed.
