[1]             
My decision after the uncontested trial of this
matter invited costs submissions from the applicant.  These have been received.
[2]             
The parties were married on July 10, 1993, after
about a year of co-habitation.  They had two children, now adults, and
separated on August 1, 2017.  They entered into a Separation Agreement dated
February 11, 2018, but the Respondent allegedly failed to abide by it.  Under
the Separation Agreement, spousal support was to start in February, 2020, but
did not.  Rather, the Respondent made only twenty-one payments of $1,260 each
in most months between March 1, 2021, and December 1, 2022, inclusive.  The
Respondent also cut off the Applicant’s access to medical benefits and provided
no proof that he was complying with the Separation Agreement.
[3]             
The applicant claimed for spousal support,
medical insurance coverage, life insurance coverage on the respondent and her
designation as a beneficiary of his RRSP investments, all as provided for in
the separation agreement.
[4]             
The applicant’s needs were great.  She had
health problems, had no employment, and required money for housing and
prescriptions but had been refused social assistance because of the separation agreement.
[5]             
The applicant’s evidence was that the respondent
had been well employed in a trade with pension and benefits.  However, she was
unable to get current information about that because of his non-cooperation.
[6]             
It was found that the respondent was aware of
the court proceedings but was not taking them seriously nor living up to his
obligations under the separation agreement.
[7]             
In the result, the respondent was ordered to pay
spousal support, to provide ongoing proof of meeting the requirements of the
separation agreement, and to pay costs.
[8]             
The applicant’s costs submissions noted the
history of the case as touched on above, the need for her to bring five
motions, the failure of the respondent to produce any offer to settle, and the
requirement to prepare for and attend at the uncontested trial.  The hourly
rate and the total costs claimed were modest.
[9]              
Modern costs rules are intended to serve three
purposes:
[10]          
It has been held that a fourth fundamental
purpose has been added by the primary objective of the Family Law Rules,
that cases be dealt with justly. [2]
Justly is defined in the Rules to include:
[11]          
“In the case of Boucher v. Public Accountants
Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 71 O. R. (3d) (Ont. C.A.), the
Ontario Court of Appeal indicated that a costs award should be a “fair and
reasonable amount that should be paid by the unsuccessful parties rather than
any exact measure of the actual costs of the successful litigant”.  A “fair and
reasonable amount” is that amount which the unsuccessful party could reasonably
have expected to pay in the event of lack of success in the litigation.”[3]
[12]          
Family Law Rule 24 commences with the
presumption that a successful party is entitled to its costs.  Rule 24(12)
requires that, in setting the amount of costs, the court shall consider:
[13]          
“(Under) the Family Law Rules … judges
are not constrained to the normal scales of costs found in the Rules of
Civil Procedure…since no scales of costs are mentioned in the Family Law
Rules.”[4] 
Rule 24(12) sets out the appropriate considerations in fixing the quantum of
costs.”[5] 
As the wording of the Rule makes clear, proportionality and reasonableness are
the touchstone considerations to be applied in fixing the amount of costs.[6]
[14]          
[33] Although they are not specified in Rule
24(11) as factors in determining costs, the financial means of the parties,
their ability to pay a costs order and the effect of any costs ruling on the
parties and the children of the family are also relevant considerations in
reaching a determination on the issue of costs.  Fyfe v. Jouppien, 2012
ONSC 97 (CanLII).
[15]          
Taking into account the law and rules about
costs awards as interpreted in various court decisions, I find that the
applicant’s request for costs of $3,000.00 inclusive is appropriate in the
circumstances of the case and I award that amount, to be paid by the respondent
to the applicant forthwith.
