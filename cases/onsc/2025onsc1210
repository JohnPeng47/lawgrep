The registrar’s office referred this motion to
me pursuant to rule 2.1.01(7) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, following
receipt of a written request under rule 2.1.01(6) from the lawyers for the respondent
FP Canada.[1]
[2]              
On February 10, 2025, I directed the registrar
to give notice to Mr. Rahman that the court was considering making an order
dismissing the application under rule 2.1.01.[2]
The registrar notified Mr. Rahman and invited him to make written submissions
explaining why the application should not be dismissed. Mr. Rahman provided
written submissions, which I have reviewed.
[3]              
I dismiss the application because I find it to
be frivolous.
[4]              
Rule 2.1.01 permits the court to stay or dismiss
a proceeding if the proceeding appears on its face to be frivolous or vexatious
or otherwise an abuse of process of the court. In Gao v. Ontario (Workplace
Safety and Insurance Board), Myers J. explained:
[5]              
The Court of Appeal approved of this approach.[4]
[6]              
A frivolous proceeding lacks a legal basis or
legal merit or has been brought without reasonable grounds.[5] A frivolous proceeding is
one that is readily recognizable as devoid of merit, as one having little
prospect of success.[6]
A frivolous application is one that will necessarily or inevitably fail.[7]
[7]              
The court is not to use rule 2.1.01 for close
calls. However, neither the opposing parties nor the court should be required
to devote scarce resources to proceedings that are clearly frivolous. Allowing
such proceedings to occupy space on the court docket takes time away from
other, more meritorious cases. There is simply no benefit to allowing clearly
frivolous proceedings to continue.[8]
[8]              
I conclude the application is frivolous because
it will inevitably fail.
[9]              
First, the notice of application is not in
appropriate form. The notice of application itself includes an unsworn
affidavit and exhibits that include various pieces of correspondence, and personal
identity documents. At a minimum, the notice of application would need to be
struck out with leave to deliver one in proper form. However, there are much
more serious problems with the application.
[10]          
The application seeks an order in the following
form:
[11]          
This relief is not available on an application
to the Superior Court of Justice and, therefore, the application is frivolous.
[12]          
Mr. Rahman purports to bring this application under
rule 14.05. However, rule 14.05 assumes jurisdiction, it does not create it. Mr.
Rahman has not identified a statute that permits him to commence this
proceeding by way of application.[9]
Mr. Rahman states that the application is brought under s. 392.5(11) of the Insurance
Act.[10]
That section authorizes the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Services
Regulatory Authority to reinstate a licence that has been revoked for
non-payment of a fee or administrative penalty. It does not authorize the
commencement of an application in the Superior Court of Justice.
[13]          
Similarly, Mr. Rahman is not seeking the type of
relief that is contemplated by rule 14.05(3). Although Mr. Rahman makes a
passing reference seeking a remedy under the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, the notice of application does not allege that any of his rights
under the Charter were infringed. Moreover, the law is clear that the Charter
does not protect a person’s access to a licence because that is only an
economic interest, which is not subject to Charter protection.[11] Any such application
would be doomed to fail.
[14]          
While Mr. Rahman could conceivably seek to
obtain the relief he desires by way of either statutory appeal (if one is available)
or application for judicial review pursuant to the Judicial Review
Procedures Act (if the decisions were made in the exercise of a statutory
power of decision or had a sufficiently public character), he may not do so by
way of an application in the Superior Court of Justice pursuant to Rule 14.[12]
[15]          
This application is frivolous because it will
necessarily or inevitably fail. I dismiss the action pursuant to rule 2.1.01(1),
without costs.
