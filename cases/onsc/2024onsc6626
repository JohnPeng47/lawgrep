Over the past three years this
family has imploded. The parties’ only child has suffered, and continues to
suffer, immeasurably.
[2]              
The Respondent (“father”) exerts
power and control proactively (including repeated breaches of the temporary
order and perpetuating unfounded allegations).
The father engages in behaviours that are commonly attributable to being
an alienating parent.
[3]              
The Applicant’s (“mother”) use of
power and control is reactive, often in response to the father and/or
in relation to her own challenges with anxiety, depression and self-worth. At times
the mother has used her power and control to take positions that are not in the child’s
best interests (such as delaying consent to the child’s return to in-person
school).
