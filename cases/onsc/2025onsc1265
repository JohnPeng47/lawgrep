The applicant, Douglas LaFramboise, brought this
application under Rule 59.06(2)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure
seeking to set aside Justice S.K. Stothart’s trial decision dated January 2,
2024.[2]
[2]              
A summary of the grounds for the application
were pleaded as follows:
[3]              
The respondent filed materials opposing the
applicant on all grounds and took the position that the application was an
abuse of process.
[4]              
After having reviewed all materials by the
applicant and respondent, I heard argument from the applicant and dismissed the
motion.  My brief reasons follow.
[5]              
Section 59.06(2) provides that a party who seeks
to have an order set aside or varied on the grounds of fraud of facts arising
or discovered after it was made, may make a motion in the proceeding for the
relief sought.
[6]              
The applicant also appealed the same decision to
the Ontario Court of Appeal[3]
on a motion for fresh evidence. In that appeal, he plead that Ms. Zwaan had
perjured herself in reference to the bank statements.
[7]              
The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on October
31, 2024.
[8]              
The applicant filed this motion on December 20,
2024.
[9]              
The applicant also initiated an action against
counsel, Mr. Kostyniuk, in Brampton on the same basis, that is, that he
suborned perjury. That action was dismissed as an abuse of process by Justice
M.T. Doi on January 20, 2025.[4]
[10]          
In addition to finding that the appellant had
not met the second and third prongs of the test set out in St. Amand regarding
fresh evidence,[5]
the Court of Appeal firmly rejected the appellant’s submission that the bank
records demonstrated perjury (referenced below).
[11]          
The applicant has not raised any new issue in
this motion; he is simply attempting a different avenue to dispense with a
decision that he is unhappy with.
[12]          
The applicant rests his argument under section
59.06(2) primarily on International Corona Resources Ltd. v. LAC
Minerals Ltd. [“LAC Minerals”].[6]  In that case, Osborne,
J. sets out nine (9) factors to consider in a section 59.06(2) motion.[7]  I will review them
below:
[13]          
I reject the applicant’s argument that the
transcripts disclose perjury. The transcripts clearly indicate that the
respondent did not have the relevant bank statements before her at the time her
evidence was given. The Court of Appeal directly addresses this at paragraph 30
of their decision, and I agree with the characterization of the evidence as
follows:
[14]          
The bank statements of Ms. Zwaan were not relevant
to the issue of whether Mr. LaFramboise deposited the check into his personal
account without permission, rather than into his trust account. He did not
plead this as a defence. I find that the statements do not go to the foundation
of the case.
[15]          
Moreover, the Court of Appeal found that with
reasonable diligence, the bank statements would have been available at the time
of trial and Ms. Zwaan would have had an opportunity to review them and provide
her evidence having done so. The applicant did not act with due diligence to
obtain the evidence prior to the trial. The applicant ought to have known that
the statements would exist had this been his intended defence.
[16]          
Ultimately, the defendants delayed bringing this
motion until after receiving an unfavourable decision from the Court of
Appeal.  This is a blatant attempt to relitigate the issues already decided by
the Superior Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal.  Even if this delay is
not significant enough to weigh against Mr. LaFramboise, I find his conduct in
bringing collateral attacks following the dismissal by the Court of Appeal to
be an abuse of process.
[17]          
Mr. LaFramboise was entitled to seek an appeal
or to set aside the trial decision.  He chose to appeal the trial decision.  He
now seeks a second course of action to set aside the court’s trial decision. Both
as an abuse of process, and on the foregoing assessment on its merits, this
motion is dismissed.
[18]          
The respondent was entirely successful on this
application.  Therefore, she is entitled to costs. The parties shall provide
their submissions with respect to the issue of costs in writing, limited to
three (3) typewritten pages, excluding attachments, as follows:
[19]          
Submissions received beyond these deadlines will
not be considered.
