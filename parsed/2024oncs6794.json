    "summary": "The court ruled the testament and clause 6.6(a) are valid. Although there was dispute about the recognition of the testator's signature under Article 4(2)(b), the court found that the actions of the testator amounted to an implicit recognition of her signature. The discussion about Jocelyne Gravelle having the option to purchase the home for the remaining mortgage amount was concluded to be valid despite the mortgage balance being zero at the time of death. Thus, the court interpreted the intent was to provide Jocelyne an option to acquire the house effectively as a gift without any mortgage encumbrance. Julie Gravelle Desormeaux is required to account for her administration since the death of Jeanne Gravelle."
