The respondent brings this motion to change the
December 16, 1992 Order of Justice Morin. Pursuant to that order, the
respondent was obligated to pay $200 per month in child support for the benefit
of the parties’ children, Gaetan and Martin. The order included an 8% annual
interest rate.
[2]              
On July 24, 1995, Madam Justice Metivier
terminated the respondent’s child support obligations.
[3]              
The respondent did not make any payment towards the
child support arrears until August of 2021, except for one payment of $100, resulting
in significant accrued interest. In this motion, he seeks an order rescinding
the interest owed under Justice Morin’s order or, alternatively, reducing his
ongoing interest payments to $50 per month.
[4]              
Pursuant to section 19 of O. Reg 167/97,
payments made on account of a support order and support deduction order must
first be credited to the principal, and then to any interest on that principal.
Using this methodology, the respondent owes $14,078.85 in interest, in addition
to the principal of $6,200.
[5]              
With the exception of one $100 payment, the
respondent did not make any payments toward his child support obligation until
August 6, 2021. Before 2021, he was receiving social assistance and
subsequently ODSP. Because his spouse is also an ODSP recipient, they received “family
benefits” which were paid directed to her, as it is the Ontario Government’s
practice to pay ODSP family benefits to the spouse who first applies for them.
In the respondent's case, his spouse applied first; thus, the Family
Responsibility Office (FRO) could not garnish these payments.
[6]              
In 2021, the respondent began receiving Old Age
Security (OAS) benefits. Unlike ODSP payments, OAS payments were made directly
to him, and the respondent currently receives $1,327.69 per month in OAS
benefits.  When he started receiving OAS benefits, the FRO began garnishing his
benefits.
[7]              
Initially, the FRO garnished $397.38 from his
OAS benefits. The respondent sought to reduce this to $50 per month on the
ground of undue hardship. The FRO subsequently garnished thirteen $50 payments
from the respondent. Following a motion to change initiated by the respondent,
at the applicant’s request, the FRO began garnishing 50% of his OAS benefits
from November 2022 to February 2023. The respondent entered into an agreement
that reduced his support deductions to $253.45 per month, which remained in
place until February 2024, after which the FRO once again deducted 50% of his OAS
benefits. The respondent has since entered into a new agreement to set his
monthly payments at $320.
[8]              
As of today, the respondent has paid the entire
principal sum of child support ($6,200) and $3,971.82 in interest, but he still
owes $10,342.03 in interest.
[9]              
After the deduction of $320 from his OAS
benefit, the respondent is left with $1,007 per month. His share of rent is
$435 per month, which leaves him with only $572 to cover his other expenses.
The respondent claims that his financial situation is dire and that he cannot
afford to pay for certain necessities, including medication.
[10]          
The respondent has health issues that qualified
him for ODSP. He has provided evidence of ongoing care from a urologist,
requiring medication costing $241.79 between four to six times per year. He was
also hospitalized for psychiatric reasons on February 22, 2024, at Queensway
Carleton Hospital, where his psychiatrist indicated that the child support
enforcement issues have caused him acute distress, leading to suicidal
thoughts.
[11]          
In August 2023, the respondent received an
inheritance of $18,000 from his mother's estate. He utilized this money to pay
debts accumulated from FRO's enforcement of child support arrears.
Additionally, he purchased a 2014 Hyundai Accent for $10,000, which is
registered in his spouse's name. The vehicle is used for transport to medical
appointments and grocery shopping, as they reside in Clarence Creek, a small
town with minimal services which is a 35-minute drive to Ottawa.
[12]          
The respondent’s spouse provided a letter
indicating that the past few years have been extremely challenging from both
financial and psychological perspectives.
[13]          
The applicant objects to any reduction in the
interest owed to her.
[14]          
She contends that she has raised the parties'
sons without any financial support from the respondent. The applicant argues
that the respondent could have taken steps to pay off his debt earlier but
chose not to do so. She asserts that when the respondent received an
inheritance, he could have allocated a portion of those funds toward his child
support obligation. As a widow, she emphasizes that she cannot afford to
renounce the sum that is legally owed to her.
[15]          
The applicant requests that 50% of the
respondent's Old Age Security (OAS) payments be garnished and that the
calculation of amounts owed be calculated differently from the methodology set
out in O. Reg 167/97. Specifically, she seeks an order that the respondent’s
payments be applied pro-rata to both principal and interest, similar to the
manner in which banks apply payments to credit card debt.
[16]          
Furthermore, she states that the respondent’s
debt in 1992 dollars is worth $10,004 in today's dollars due to inflation.
[17]          
The applicant also notes that the respondent and
his spouse’s combined annual income is $34,000, and they possess a vehicle. She
requests an order for the seizure and sale of the car to satisfy the debt owed.
[18]          
In Colucci v. Colucci, 2021 SCC 24
(“Colucci”), the Supreme Court clarified that a payor's claim for rescission
may be regarded as a "hardship" application when the arrears consist
of amounts that the payor could have paid when they were due (Colucci, para
134). The payor’s current financial capacity is the sole relevant factor, and
they must provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a precarious financial
situation. The payor is required to successfully challenge a “presumption
against rescinding any part of the arrears” (Colucci, para 138).
[19]          
Courts should adopt a highly restrictive
approach to guarantee that rescission is regarded as a "last resort"
option (Colucci, para 138). The presumption will only be rebutted when the
payor parent establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that—despite a
flexible payment plan—they cannot and will not ever be able to pay the arrears.
A present inability to pay does not automatically eliminate the prospect of
future ability to pay, although it may warrant a temporary suspension of arrears.
[20]          
This presumption ensures that rescission is
available only as a last resort, when suspension or other creative payment
options are inadequate to alleviate the payor’s prejudice. It also encourages
payors to fulfill their support obligations rather than allowing arrears to
accumulate in the hope of obtaining relief from the courts when the amount
becomes significant. Arrears are considered a “valid debt that must be paid,
similar to any other financial obligation,” regardless of their magnitude. If
the court determines that the payor’s financial circumstances will create
challenges in paying down the arrears, it should first explore whether hardship
can be alleviated through a temporary suspension, periodic payments, or other
creative payment arrangements.
[21]          
I express significant sympathy for the
applicant, who has borne sole responsibility for financially supporting the
parties' children. I concur with her assertion that the respondent could have
taken measures over the past 30 years to make modest payments toward his child
support obligations. Had he made such efforts, he would not find himself in the
difficult predicament he faces today.
[22]          
That said, I also conclude that fully enforcing
the child support order imposes hardship on the respondent, who has relied on
social assistance, ODSP, and now the Old Age Security (OAS) program. He has
very limited financial means, and strict enforcement of the order renders him
unable to meet his basic expenses, including medication. Furthermore, I take
into account that the principal portion of the child support order has been
fully paid and that the 8% interest rate, while applicable in 1992, is
significantly higher than the interest rates that have been in effect over the
last 20 years.
[23]          
I decline to order that any payments the
respondent made be applied pro-rata to both principal and interest, similar to
the manner in which banks apply payments to credit card debt.  Subsection 19(2)
of O. Reg. 167/97 provides two specific situations in which payments made
toward a support order may be credited differently than outlined in subsection
19(1). Such an adjustment may occur where the support order has been assigned
to an agency or social assistance provider, or where the support order and
support deduction order explicitly state that payments should be credited in a
different manner. As neither of these conditions are present in this case, the
payments made by the respondent must be credited first to the principal and
then to the interest accrued on that principal.
[24]          
I determine that the respondent’s outstanding
interest debt should be set at $2,229, which corresponds to the total repayment
of the principal plus 100% of the arrears in interest ($3,971 + $2,229 =
$6,200).
[25]          
This amount recognizes that the principle that
arrears are debts that must be repaid, takes into account the historically low
rates that have prevailed after Justice Morin’s order, while also recognizing
the respondent’s dire financial situation.
[26]          
I also order that the Family Responsibility
Office enforce the remaining balance owed at a rate of $75 per month, and
collect 100% of any lump sum payments the respondent receives, until the debt
is fully paid.
[27]          
I make no order as to costs.
