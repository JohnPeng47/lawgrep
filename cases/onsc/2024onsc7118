[1]               Elizabeth Anderson (“Betty”) was born March 13, 1935.
[2]               She died on July 16, 1921.
[3]               The parties to this Application are her 4 children surviving her.  Sadly, they have chosen to litigate with each other over Betty’s estate, mostly consisting of her modest home.
[4]               The applicant, Betty’s daughter Wendy, lived with her mother in her mother's home in Belleville for over 30 years before Betty died.
[5]               In July 2012, Betty executed a will prepared by her lawyer which equally distributed her estate to her children. This is consistent with her two prior solicitor drafted wills made in March 2010, and November 1979. I observe that the 2012 Will left the contents of the home to Wendy.
[6]               At issue is a document, apparently handwritten, with a date at the top of “Jan 5/16” stating:
[7]               Wendy received this document from Betty, but she does not know when. She was not present when it was written. She was surprised to receive it. She did not know her mother would be writing such a document.
[8]               Wendy says the document is in her mother's handwriting.
[9]               Wendy did not disclose the document until after her mother's death.
[10]           Betty’s son Douglas deposed that Wendy delivered an undated Christmas card to his wife in similar form and to the same effect.
[11]           Betty's home is the most significant asset of her estate, and I am told by counsel that its value is $500,000.
[12]           Medical and care records from 2010 onward were filed under the Evidence Act. These show ongoing concern for an assessment of Betty's declining cognitive function.
[13]           Betty's pastor deposed that he had known Betty since 2013 when she joined his church. She would have been 78 years of age. He deposed that in 2015, she regularly demonstrated confusion about losing her purse. In 2015 or 2016, she demonstrated that on one occasion she thought it was Sunday.  In fact, it was Tuesday.  He did not see her after she stopped attending church in 2017.
[14]           An expert report commissioned by the respondents was admitted into evidence following a voir dire. Doctor Herrmann was accepted as an expert as an academic physician specializing in the assessment, management and research of memory disorders in late life, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia associated with cerebrovascular disease and other dementias.
[15]           He had reviewed the application record, home care records and the family doctor records from 2010 onward. He concluded:
[16]           The issue is whether the applicant has met the onus on her to prove that the January 5, 2016 document is a valid, lawful, enforceable holograph will.
[17]           The requirements of a holograph will are set out in s. 6 of the Succession Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26:
[18]           Also relevant to this application is s. 13 of the Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 23:
[19]           In Bennett v. Toronto General Trusts Corp., 1958 CarswellMan 66 (SCC), the court stated:
[20]           In McKenzie v. Hill, 2022 ONSC 4881, Williams, J. pointed out that a testamentary gift occurs when the donor intends to make a gift that is effective only at the donor’s death and is revocable until then - the gift is said to be dependent on death for its vigour and effect (para. 24). The learned justice stated that she attempted to read the document generously and to ascribe plain and ordinary meaning to the words that the deceased had chosen. In that case, the court held that the document was not a lawful holograph will because it read as an agreement to transfer and did not state that the transfer would be effective only upon death. At paragraph 31, the court pointed out, “Ms. Hillman did not use the word “will’’ nor did she say that she wanted “to leave” the condo to Mr. McKenzie, from which one could also make an inference in respect of her intention. Instead, Ms. Hillman made no reference to her death”.
[21]           In R v. Abdi, (1997) 1997 CanLII 4448 (ON CA), 116 CCC (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.), the court held that the trier of fact is entitled to compare disputed handwriting with admitted or proven writing in documents which are properly in evidence in drawing inferences therefrom without the assistance of an expert or lay witness. It held that the comparison does not necessarily require expertise or particular knowledge of the relevant handwriting. The question is the weight to be attached to the evidence and the manner in which the trier of fact is to be cautioned in this respect. The potential danger in making unassisted comparisons exists and the trier of fact should be reminded that it has no expert or other evidence relating to the writings and should exercise care in making the comparison. The trier of fact should consider whether the comparison is of sufficient length and clarity.
[22]           These are set out in Vout v. Hay 1995 CanLII 105 (SCC), 1995 CarswellOnt 186 (SCC), paragraphs 26, 27 and 28.
[23]           Firstly, the burden is on the applicant with respect to due execution, knowledge and approval and testamentary capacity. “The propounder is aided by a rebuttable presumption”. “Upon proof that the will was duly executed with the requisite formalities, after having been read over to or by a testator who appeared to understand, it will generally be presumed that the testator knew and approved of the contents and had the necessary testamentary capacity”. (Emphasis added).
[24]           Secondly, the burden is on those attacking the purported will which is satisfied by pointing to “some evidence”, which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval or testamentary capacity. These suspicious circumstances may be raised by:
[25]           Thirdly, where such suspicious circumstances are present, the rebuttable presumption is spent and the propounder of the will re-assumes the legal burden of proving knowledge and approval. If the suspicious circumstances relate to a mental capacity, the propounder of the will reassumes the legal burden of establishing testimony capacity. Both of these issues must be proved in accordance with the civil standard proportionate to the gravity of the suspicion.
[26]           The Ontario Court of Appeal addresses the issues in Stekar v. Wilcox, 2017 ONCA 1010 at paragraph 8. The Court also made the distinction that the trial judge in that case did not find that the deceased lacked the requisite testamentary capacity when the purported will was executed but rather held that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden to prove that the deceased possessed the necessary testamentary capacity at the relevant time. (Para. 13).
[27]           In Stekar, the Court stated the test for testamentary capacity,
[28]           The Court went on to say under the heading, “Knowledge and Approval”,
[29]           In McKenzie, having found that suspicious circumstances existed, Justice Williams held:
[30]           Justice Leroy set out a non-exhaustive list in Salmon v. Rombough, 2024 ONSC 1186, paragraph 66:
[31]           In Salmon, Justice Leroy relied on a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal as follows:
[32]           He had ruled that the expert report was inadmissible in that case. He held that although the report was relevant, it was unnecessary. He held that the medical records filed under the Evidence Act were properly before the court and that if the medical records had referenced capacity deficits, the respondent would have referenced them.
[33]           The Alberta court in Burby v. Ball, 2017 ABQB 300 issues a caution about such expert assessments:
[34]           Wendy says this is her mother's handwriting and signature. She did not see it written by her mother. There is no evidence that she saw the Christmas card that she gave to Doug's wife written by her mother.
[35]           The respondents deny that the document is Betty's handwriting.
[36]           There is no expert evidence on the point.
[37]           Wendy deposed that “Elizabeth presented me” with the document. There is no evidence of any words spoken, when or the circumstances.
[38]           I am asked by the applicant to compare the writing and signature of the document with the Christmas card and the pacemaker note bearing a date of “Jan 14, 2015” contained in the caregivers’ records entered February 14, 2020, to conclude that the document is Betty’s handwriting.
[39]           The latter record states “slowly progressive dementia since 2010 at least”.
[40]           The writing and signature and form on the 3 documents are similar.  The subject document uses the words “I leave”. (McKenzie).  Based on this, I am prepared to find that the subject document meets the requirements of s. 6 of the Succession Law Reform Act.
[41]           I find that there are suspicious circumstances present within the meaning of the authorities.
[42]           The suspicious circumstances include,
[43]           In the face of the suspicious circumstances, Wendy bears the onus of satisfying the court, on the balance of probabilities, that Betty knew and approved the contents of the document.
[44]           Wendy does not know when she received the document. There is no evidence as to the circumstances of its creation or the actual date Betty wrote it other than the date on it.
[45]           There are no witnesses to its creation or as to anything said by Betty about its creation.
[46]           There is no evidence about what Betty or Wendy said to each other when the document was presented, “Why?”, “Thanks Mom”.
[47]           There is no contemporaneous direct evidence of Betty's testamentary capacity on January 5, 2016.
[48]           There is no evidence that the document was read over to or by Betty who appeared to understand it. The medical records and caregiver records clearly show concerns about and treatment for progressing dementia in the years preceding January 2016.
[49]           There is no material corroborative evidence for Wendy's evidence.
[50]           I make no finding about Betty's actual testamentary capacity on January 5, 2016.
[51]           However, for these reasons, I find that Wendy has failed to meet the onus on her that Betty had a sound and disposing mind at the time she made the subject document.
[52]           The application is dismissed.
[53]           The respondents may make written submissions as to costs limited to 3 pages plus a costs outline within 10 days hereof. If the respondents are requesting two sets of costs submissions, they should address why that should be so.
[54]           The applicant shall reply in like manner within 5 days of receipt of the respondents’ submissions. The parties are directed to make earnest, bona fide efforts to settle the issue of costs.
