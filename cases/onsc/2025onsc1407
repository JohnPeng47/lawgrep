[1]              
This Estate Application was originally issued in
April of 2023, and has been the subject of several previous motions and court
orders.
[2]              
Jacqueline Last (“Jacqueline”) was the mother of
the Applicant Glen Last (“Glen”) and the Respondent Craig Last (“Craig”). She
died on November 16, 2021, at the age of 79. She was predeceased by her
husband. Glen and Craig were her only children.
[3]              
The Applicant brings this motion for an Order
striking out Craig’s Notice of Appearance, and an Order that Craig’s share of
the Estate be reduced by $749,751, which is one-half the total of the
withdrawals and transactions which the Applicant alleges Craig improperly took
from the Deceased’s bank account prior to her death. The Applicant also seeks
miscellaneous costs and an interim distribution from the Estate in the amount
of $350,000 (the balance remaining in the Estate). Finally, the Applicant seeks
an Order that Craig make payment to Glen in an amount equal to the shortfall,
if any, between $749,751 and the net payment received by Glen as a beneficiary
of the Estate.
[4]              
On March 5, 2015, Jacqueline executed a Last Will
& Testament, pursuant to which Glen and Craig were named as joint Estate
Trustees and equal beneficiaries. Also on March 5, 2015, Jacqueline executed a
Continuing Power of Attorney for Property and Power of Attorney for Personal
Care, which named Glen and Craig as joint Powers of Attorney.
[5]              
On March 26, 2015, Jacqueline was involved in a
serious automobile accident. As a result of the accident Jacqueline was deemed
to have suffered “catastrophic impairment”, including cognitive impairment. She
required 24 hour attendant care as a result of the accident.
[6]              
On June 16, 2016, Glen and Craig, acting as
their mother’s Power of Attorney, signed a retainer agreement with Thompson
Rogers LLP to commence a medical malpractice case against the hospital where Jacqueline
received medical care after the car accident.
[7]              
On November 3, 2016, Jacqueline signed a
“Continuing Power of Attorney for Property”, and a “Continuing Power of
Attorney for Personal Care”, appointing only Craig as the Power of Attorney.
[8]              
Jacqueline’s lawsuit against the hospital was
settled in December 2017 for $792,936, with $22,936 to be paid to Craig to be
held in trust for Jacqueline, and the balance of $770,000 to paid into a
structured annuity to be paid to Jacqueline over a five year period at
approximately $13,575 per month, with the insurer retaining a reversionary
interest in the net settlement.
[9]              
In the fall of 2016, Craig, acting as
Jacqueline’s Power of Attorney, sold her home in Brampton and purchased a
property in Muskoka, where Jacqueline moved and lived with Craig and his
family.
[10]          
Jacqueline died on November 16, 2021.
[11]          
In February 2022, Craig and Glen began the
process of administering Jacqueline’s Estate. They retained the law firm of
Ferguson, Deacon, Taws LLP (“FDT”) to assist with the probate process.
[12]          
On April 22, 2022, FDT wrote to CIBC Bank
(“CIBC”) and TD Canada Bank (“TD”) in order to inquire as to the balance of
Jacqueline’s bank accounts as at the date of her death, the balance as at
current date, and to request information regarding any loans or investment
accounts that she had.
[13]          
On May 2, 2022, CIBC informed FDT that at the
date of death, Jacqueline had 2 accounts with CIBC and no investments or
certificates: a Chequing account with a balance of $100.41 and a Savings
account with a balance of $68.38.
[14]          
On June 3, 2022, TD informed FDT that, at the
date of her death, Jacqueline held the following accounts and credit products
with their branch:
[15]          
The Applicant believes that, in addition to
these bank accounts, Jacqueline’s Estate should have had the following assets
at the time of her death:
[16]          
The Applicant believes that, prior to her death,
Jacqueline should have had a substantial cash flow by virtue of the settlement
payment. He asserts that, due to Craig’s mismanagement of Jacqueline’s assets,
her finances were depleted or overdrawn.
[17]          
Glen sought an Order to appoint a Succeeding
Estate Trustee to replace Craig and to administer the Estate. Glen also sought
an Order to require Craig to pass formal accounts both in his capacity as Power
of Attorney and in his capacity as de facto Estate Trustee.
[18]          
On January 8, 2024, Woodley J. made an Order
appointing Howard Gangbar of MSCH Financial Services Inc. as Estate Trustee for
Jacqueline’s Estate, replacing Craig and Glen as Estate Trustee. The house in
Muskoka was vested in the Estate Trustee so that it could be sold. Glen Last
was appointed as the litigation guardian on behalf of the Estate to pursue the
Application as against Craig Last.
[19]          
On July 19, 2024, the Muskoka house was sold for
$722,500. After deductions for hydro arrears, unpaid taxes and the outstanding
balance ($106,330) owing under the TD Line of Credit, the net proceeds from the
sale were $556,885. These funds were paid to the Estate Trustee, and the
remaining balance is being held by the Estate Trustee pursuant to the Order of
Woodley J.
[20]          
On April 2, 2024,
Christie J. made an Order requiring Craig to formally pass his accounts as Jacqueline’s
attorney for property for the period of March 26, 2015
to November 16, 2021 by June 1, 2024. The Order further required Craig to
“formally account for his management of the Estate assets and any assets held
in trust for the period from November 17, 2021 to the date of delivering the
accounting”.
[21]          
On October 15, 2024, this matter returned before
Healey J. Glen took the position that Craig’s Notice of Appearance should be
struck out pursuant to Rule 60.12 for failure to comply with Christie J.’s
Order (a position Glen reiterated in the proceedings before me).
[22]          
Craig took the position that he was unable to
comply with Christie J.’s Order based on mental health issues.  He took the
position that he was a party under disability and asked that a litigation
guardian be appointed to act for him. Healey J. noted that there was no Notice
of Motion or evidence to support Craig’s position. Healey J. directed Craig to
Rule 7.03(10) and ordered that if Craig intended to bring a motion to have a
litigation guardian appointed on his behalf he had to serve his motion record
by November 22, 2024. Healey J. adjourned the application to January 2025.
[23]          
Craig did not bring a motion to have a
litigation guardian appointed on his behalf.
[24]          
Craig has not complied with Christie J.’s Order.
There has been no formal passing of accounts or accounting for the Estate
assets.
[25]          
Given Craig’s failure to pass the accounts, Glen
reviewed the banking records for the period of March 26, 2015 to November 16,
2021 that were disclosed to him. He has identified over 1,800 transactions that
he alleges can only be explained as Craig misappropriating Jacqueline’s assets
for his own benefit. He alleges that Craig has misappropriated at least
$1,489,502 from Jacqueline.
[26]          
There is approximately $350,000 remaining in the
Estate.
[27]          
Between 2015 and 2021, Glen alleges that there
was at least $1,269,715.17 in unexplained bank transfers and e-transfers out of
Jacqueline’s Bank Accounts. For the purposes of this Application, Glen has only
included the transfers or e-transfers which he can trace as being directly
received by Craig ($125,150.00) or Craig’s mother-in-law ($28,484.00). The
balance of the unexplained bank transfers and e-transfers in the amount of
$1,116,081.17 ($1,269,715.17 - $125,125.00 - $28,484.00) have been fully
excluded from Glen’s calculations. Absent further disclosure and an accounting
setting out the particular nature of these bank transfers and e-transfers, Glen
acknowledges that it is not possible for him to ascertain the total extent of
Craig’s misappropriation.
[28]          
In addition to these bank transfers and
e-transfers, Glen has calculated that between 2015 and 2021, Craig caused
$391,925.48 to be directly withdrawn from Jacqueline’s Bank Accounts by way of
cash withdrawals, bank drafts, and cheques (including at least $15,599.49 which
was withdrawn following Jacqueline’s death).
[29]          
Glen has calculated that Craig also used at
least $349,624.73 of Jacqueline’s money to directly pay off credit cards and
various lines of credit which did not belong to Jacqueline. The credit card
charges include retailers such as marinas, sports and fishing related stores,
hotels, rental cars, animal hospitals, men’s clothing, large fuel purchases, and
international purchases. There were more than $21,000 in purchases from the
LCBO and the Beer Store from 2015 to 2021.
[30]          
The Banking Transactions show that, between 2015
and 2021, at least $101,768.84 in payments were made to CIBC credit cards and
CIBC loans, that at least $152,997.08 was paid to Capital One, and that at
least $12,084.83 was paid to American Express. Between May 11, 2016 and April
27, 2017, at least $48,430.00 was withdrawn from Jacqueline’s Bank Accounts to
pay down a line of credit held with TD Bank. However, at the time, Jacqueline
had no pre-existing lines of credit.
[31]          
On or about May 17, 2017, Craig caused a Line of
Credit with TD Bank to be registered against title to the Muskoka property,
with a credit limit of $100,000.00. On the same day, $98,500.00 was deposited
into Jacqueline’s TD Account. These funds remain unaccounted for and Glen
believes that Craig made large purchases including a pontoon boat, an
industrial CNC machine, snowmobiles, and ATVs at around the same time.
[32]          
Craig failed to make the minimum monthly
payments under the TD Line of Credit, causing it to fall into significant
arrears. This resulted in TD Bank threatening Power of Sale against the Muskoka
property after Jacqueline’s death.
[33]          
Glen personally paid off the arrears on the TD
Line of Credit in order to bring it into good standing and prevent Power of
Sale proceedings from moving ahead. Glen and his wife were required to
refinance the mortgage on their home in order to do this. Although Glen has
been reimbursed for the payments he made on account of the arears, he has not
yet been reimbursed for the legal fees which he incurred.
[34]          
Based on a review of the credit card records,
Glen has calculated that Craig has spent at least $73,786.22 of Jacqueline’s
money on gambling or gambling related expenses. Craig acknowledges that he
spent at least that amount on gambling; he claims that he is a “professional
gambler” and that he used his own resources and that the income generated from
gambling exceeded any funds that he withdrew from the account.
[35]          
Glen has calculated that Craig has spent at least
$121,489.91 on account of “miscellaneous” transactions. He also alleges that
Craig took the payout value for Jacquiline’s car ($26,000) and traded that car
for a new car for himself.
[36]          
Glen has provided detailed lists and charts
setting out all of the challenged payments that he relies on to calculate the
total amount that he claims are misappropriated funds (see, for example, the 48-page
chart appended as Exhibit K to his affidavit dated September 25, 2024). These
charts are all supported by the banking information and records appended to
Glen’s affidavit. Apart from certain charges that I will discuss below, I
accept that Glen has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that Craig
misappropriated approximately $1 million from Jacqueline, during her lifetime
or after her death.
[37]          
Between September 2015 and June 2017, a numbered
company operated as “Stay at Home Care” and owned by Craig’s wife, Jaime
Duckworth (“Jaime”) submitted invoices totalling $177,492 to Intact Insurance, for
Jacqueline’s 24 hour attendant care. The monthly invoices ranged from
approximately $5,000 to $10,000 per month, depending on the number of hours
claimed, although most were for $9,900. Intact Insurance reimbursed these
claims at a maximum of $6,000 per month, and Stay at Home Care was paid a total
of approximately $114,962.17.
[38]          
Glen has raised concerns regarding the
legitimacy of these payments to Craig and Jaime. He suspects that Craig and Jaime
hired caregivers to look after Jacqueline, or that Jacqueline was moved to a
long-term care home. These suspicions are unsupported by evidence.
[39]          
The evidence I have reviewed confirms that,
after the accident, Jacqueline required 24 hour attendant care. This was one
basis for the quantum of the settlement and the establishment of a structured
settlement to cover future care costs. There are no other invoices for
attendant care from other service providers or employees during the relevant
time period.
[40]          
There is no evidence that Craig and Jaime did
not provide the attendant care that Jacqueline required and for which invoices
were rendered and paid by Intact Insurance. Further, there is no evidence that
the amount paid by Intact Insurance was unreasonable or out of line with the
market costs of such care. Without evidence of fraud or misrepresentation, Craig
and Jaime are not disentitled to these payments simply because they are
relatives: Henry v. Gore Mutual Insurance Company, 2013 ONCA 480, at
para. 45; Pelletier v. Ontario, 2013 ONSC 6898, at para. 416; Rolley
v. MacDonell, 2018 ONSC 6517, at para. 369; Rezai et al. v. Kumar et al.,
2024 ONSC 3546, at para. 31.
[41]          
Finally, these payments totalling $114,962.17 were
not made by Jacqueline, they were made by Intact Insurance. If these invoices
were fraudulent, the funds would not be returned to the Estate, but to Intact
Insurance
[42]          
Glen also claims that Craig had previously been
paid an additional $125,000 in connection with attendant care for Jacqueline.
This claim is based on a covering letter from Jacqueline’s lawyer dated
September 20, 2018, which stated “Enclosed please find our trust cheque in the
amount of $46,311.50, representing settlement funds after payment of
$770,000.00 into a structured annuity. We confirm that we have advanced you the
sum of $125,000 for attendant care pending settlement”. The letter also
references a Direction which was executed on December 6, 2017.
[43]          
That Direction instructed Jacqueline’s lawyer to
settle her motor vehicle accident claim. The Direction states that the $125,000
was previously paid “on receipt of invoices for services provided”.
[44]          
This $125,000 was not included in Glen’s total
for misappropriated funds. In any event, this amount was paid “on receipt of
invoices for services provided”, which counters any suggestion that it was
misappropriated.
[45]          
These invoices and payments are significant
because Craig claims that he and Jaime continued to provide Jacqueline with
attendant care while she lived with them in Muskoka after the settlement in
December 2017.
[46]          
While Craig failed to provide the accounting
ordered by Christie J., I am prepared to accept that Craig and Jaime continued
to provide Jacqueline with the same level of attendant care from December 2017 until
her death in November 2021, and should be compensated on the same terms.
[47]          
Even without the benefit of invoices or a formal
accounting, I am prepared to find that this would amount to $6,000 per month for
the period between December 2017 (the date of the
settlement) and November 2021 (the date of Jacqueline’s death), or $282,000
(47 months X $6,000). This conclusion is based on the fact that $6,000 per
month was the amount paid by Intact Insurance for the period prior to December
2017.
[48]          
The Applicant contends that Craig’s Notice of
Appearance should be struck under Rule 60.12 for his failure to comply with an
interlocutory order, in particular, Christie J.’s Order of April 2, 2024,
requiring Craig to formally pass his accounts.
[49]          
While I have considerable sympathy for the
Applicant’s position on this issue, it is not necessary for me to address this
issue. Even if I admit the material filed by Craig on this Application, Craig
has not met his obligation to provide the accounting necessary to meet most of
the concerns raised by Glen.
[50]          
A trustee has an obligation to keep proper books
of account and must at all times be in a position to prove that he or she
administered the trust prudently and honestly and to give full information
whenever required: Wall v. Shaw, 2018 ONCA 929, at para. 23; Zimmerman
v. McMichael Estate, 2010 ONSC 2947, at para. 31; Antzon v. Rogovsky,
2025 ONSC 915, at para. 53.
[51]          
Craig’s failure to pass the accounts in
accordance with Christie J.’s Order means that he is unable to answer most of the
questions raised by Glen, and he must lose on the merits.  In Bellefeuille
v. Zinn, 2022 ONSC 5027, McCarthy J. stated, at paras. 21 and 25:
[52]          
In the case at hand, Craig was ordered to pass
his accounts by June 1, 2024. He failed to do so.
[53]          
On December 2, 2024, Craig served the Applicant
with a “Factum” in which he denied mismanaging the Estate or misappropriating
funds when acting as Jacqueline’s Power of Attorney. In this factum (which is
really an unsworn affidavit) Craig explained that he was unable to comply with
Christie J.’s Order to provide an accounting because all of the invoices and
accounts were scanned and maintained on a laptop computer that was stolen.
[54]          
Craig claims to have made over $300,000 in
repairs to the Muskoka property but has provided no invoices or other evidence
to substantiate this claim.  Glen’s review of the banking records and credit
card statements indicates that Craig made purchased from Rona, Home Depot, and
Lowes in the amount of $6,708.15. I am prepared to accept this amount as going
to repairs of the Muskoka property and deduct it from the alleged
misappropriation.
[55]          
Craig also claims that Jacqueline’s care came to
approximately $21,000 per month. He asserts that all credit card payments were
for legitimate expenses related to Jacqueline’s care, household expenses or
other “authorized purposes”. There are, however, no invoices or any other
documents or details filed to support any of these assertions.
[56]          
That said, as indicated above, I am prepared to
accept that Jacqueline’s attendant care between December 2017 and November 2021
must be valued at $6,000 per month. Craig should receive credit for this
amount.
[57]          
Craig further asserts that one of the TD bank
accounts was a joint account with both Jacqueline and his name on the
accounts.  He asserts that, as a joint account holder, he was entitled to use
the funds in the account for his own purposes and does not have to account for
his use of any of these funds.
[58]          
When an adult child is made a joint bank account
holder, there is a presumption of resulting trust, and the onus is on Craig to
demonstrate that he was intended to be a recipient of the funds in the account
rather than a trustee to facilitate the management of Jacqueline’s financial
affairs.
[59]          
The Supreme Court of Canada explained the
presumption of resulting trust in the case of Pecore v. Pecore, 2007 SCC
17, at paras. 20 – 25:
[60]          
In Pecore, the majority of the Supreme
Court altered the historical presumption of advancement that applied in cases
of gifts between spouses and gifts between a parent and child. Importantly for
the purposes of this case, the Court held, at paras. 36 – 41, that the
presumption of advancement that historically applied between a parent and a
child would no longer apply between a parent and an adult child.
[61]          
In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted, at
para. 36, that “it is common nowadays for ageing parents to transfer their
assets into joint accounts with their adult children in order to have that
child assist them in managing their financial affairs”.  The Court concluded:
[62]          
In this case Craig has not successfully rebutted
the presumption of resulting trust, and I hold that he was named as a joint
account holder as a trustee to help Jacqueline manage her financial affairs.
This is consistent with his status as Power of Attorney for Property.
Accordingly, he must account for any withdrawals from all of the bank accounts,
including the joint account, but he has failed to do so.
[63]          
Glen also claims occupation rent for the 23
month period in which Craig continued to live in the Muskoka house following
Jacqueline’s death: Lima v. Ventura (Estate of), 2020 ONSC 3278, at
para. 49; Koutsovasilis v. Carreira, 2024 ONSC 4736, at para. 171; Calmusky
v. Calmusky, 2020 ONSC 1506, at para. 73. Occupation rent may be found
owing when one of the beneficiaries continues to occupy the home after the
deceased’s death, thus denying the estate the opportunity to rent the property
and earn income: Lima, at paras. 52 – 53.
[64]          
Glen has provided a number of rental listings
for properties which he claims are comparable to the Muskoka home. These other
properties range from a waterfront ski chalet renting for $4,500 per month to a
more modest home renting for $2,800 per month.  Based on these comparable
listings, he claims that the fair market value rent for the Muskoka property
was $3,250 per month, and argues that Craig should be required to pay $81,075
($3,250 X 23) to the Estate.
[65]          
Craig disputes the assertion that $3,250 per
month was the fair market rent for the property. He argues that the Muskoka
property was located in a rural area with limited amenities. He proposes that a
fair market rent would be closer to $1,800 per month.
[66]          
I am not prepared to accept Glen’s estimate of
fair market rent for the property. There is no suggestion that he is qualified
to provide opinion evidence of fair market rent, or that he has done any
analysis of the location or amenities available to the various properties he
references as “comparable”. The fact that he would include a waterfront ski
chalet in his analysis of comparable properties puts into serious doubt the
validity of his opinion on this issue.
[67]          
Accordingly, I will accept Craig’s admission
that the Muskoka property could rent for $1,800 per month, and I conclude that
Craig’s total occupation rent payable to the Estate should be $41,400.
[68]          
Glen has calculated the amount misappropriated
from Jacqueline while she was alive or from her Estate to be approximately
$1,489,502. This total was calculated as follows:
[69]          
In the absence of a formal accounting, it is
impossible to calculate the precise amount that was misappropriated by Craig
between 2015 and 2021. Given Craig’s failure to comply with the Order of
Christie J. and provide an accounting, it is appropriate to draw an adverse
inference against Craig with respect to most of these bank transfers and other
charges.
[70]          
That said, I have concluded that there is
sufficient evidence in the record to support the following amounts, and I
conclude that these amounts should be deducted from Glen’s total:
[71]          
Based on the findings set out above, Craig has
been unable to account for $1,047,156 ($1,489,502.59 - $442,345.86) appropriated
from Jacqueline and the Estate. Fifty percent of that amount will be deducted
from his share of the Estate.
[72]          
This Court Orders:
[73]          
The Applicant seeks costs on a substantial
indemnity basis in the amount of $90,000.
[74]          
This litigation was made necessary because of
Craig’s failure to comply with a court order and provide the accounting
necessary for the Applicant and the Court to properly review Craig’s management
of Jacqueline’s assets. Accordingly, this is an appropriate case in which to
make an order for costs on a substantial indemnity basis.
[75]          
Costs of the Application are fixed at $90,000, inclusive
of HST payable by Craig Last to Glen Last, within 30 days of the date of this
Order.
