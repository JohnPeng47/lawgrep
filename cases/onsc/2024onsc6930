This is a motion by the Plaintiff/Defendant by Counterclaim, 2455993 Ontario
Inc. (“245”) for security for costs in respect of the Counterclaim brought by
the Defendant/Plaintiff by Counterclaim, Solace Is Comfort Inc. (“SIC”). 245
seeks an order requiring SIC to post $45,000.
[2]                 
This action arises from a lease agreement dated March 16, 2016 between
245 as owner and SIC as tenant dated March 16, 2016 (the “Lease”) for the
premises at 62 Marine Parade Drive, Unit 3, Toronto (the “Unit”). SIC operated a
specialty retail business from the Unit offering mastectomy and post-surgical
garments, swimwear, orthotics, diabetic footwear, custom bracing and related
products from December 1, 2016 until 245 terminated the Lease on May 30, 2019. There
were disputes between 245 and SIC with respect to rent, additional rent (SIC’s
share of expenses) and the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (“HVAC”)
system.
[3]                 
245 commenced this action under the Simplified Rules by Notice of Action
issued on February 27, 2020 and Statement of Claim dated March 25, 2020. 245 claims
$59,224.61 for outstanding rent and operating costs. SIC delivered a Defence
and Counterclaim on November 1, 2020. In its Counterclaim, SIC claims damages
of $525,271.80 including: $77,271.84 for the return of rent and additional
rent; $85,000 for maintenance work; $33,000 for lost revenue before vacating
the Unit; $10,0000 for moving and storage; and $150,000 for unrealized profits
from inventory owned. This matter is still proceeding under the Simplified
Rules.
[4]                 
This motion first came before me on June 24, 2024. Only 65 minutes was
scheduled which was insufficient and the motion was adjourned to today for 3
hours.
[5]                 
For the reasons that follow, I conclude that it is just in the
circumstances for SIC to post security for costs on the terms set out below.
[6]                 
Rule 56.01(1) states:
[7]                 
Rule 56.01(1) does not create a prima facie right to security for
costs but rather triggers an enquiry whereby the court, using its broad
discretion, considers multiple factors to make such order as is just in the
circumstances including the merits of the claim, the financial circumstances of
the plaintiff and the possibility of an order for security for costs preventing
a bona fide claim from proceeding (Stojanovic v. Bulut, 2011 ONSC
874 at paras. 4-5). The court has broad latitude to make any order that is just
in the circumstances (Yuen v. Pan, 2018 ONSC 2600 at para. 14)
[8]                 
In Yaiguaje v. Chevron Corp., 2017
ONCA 827, the Court of Appeal held as follows:
[9]                 
Determining the order which is just in the circumstances requires a
balancing between ensuring that meritorious claims are allowed to go forward
with the consequences of being left with an unenforceable costs award where a
party pursues an unsuccessful claim (Ascent Inc. v. Fox 40
International Inc., [2007] O.J. No. 1800 at para. 3; Rosin v.
Dubic, 2016 ONSC 6441 at para. 39; Lipson v. Lipson, 2020
ONSC 1324 at paras. 47-48). In some cases, security is required to correct the
imbalance of a plaintiff having security for a successful claim while a
defendant has no security for a successful defence and to prevent a plaintiff
from going to trial without posting security, be unsuccessful then avoid paying
costs (2232117 Ontario Inc. v. Somasundaram, 2020 ONSC 1434 at
para. 27; DK Manufacturing Group Ltd. v. Co-Operators Insurance, 2021
ONSC 661 at para. 26).
[10]             
The initial onus is on the defendant to show that the plaintiff falls
within one of the enumerated categories in Rule 56.01(1). The plaintiff can
rebut the onus and avoid security for costs by showing that they have
sufficient assets in Ontario or a reciprocating jurisdiction to satisfy a costs
order; the order is unjust or unnecessary; or the plaintiff should be permitted
to proceed to trial despite its impecuniosity should it fail (Travel Guild
Inc. v. Smith, 2014 CarswellOnt 19157 (S.C.J.) at para.16; Coastline
Corp. v. Canaccord Capital Corp., 2009 CanLII 21758 (ON SC), [2009] O.J. No. 1790 (ONSC) at para.
7; Cobalt Engineering v. Genivar Inc., 2011 ONSC 4929 at para. 16). This
was summarized by Master Glustein (as he then was) in Coastline:
[11]             
Heidi Scott, SIC’s principal, confirmed during
her examination for discovery that SIC is not operational. She also states in
her affidavit filed on this motion that Amoena Canada terminated its exclusive
supplier agreement with SIC on June 6, 2019 effectively ending SIC’s business. SIC
provided its answers to undertakings on September 16, 2022 including banking and
financial statements for 2016-2019.
[12]             
225’s submits that SIC is insolvent,
which SIC denies. It is not necessary for 225 to demonstrate that SIC is
insolvent. The light initial onus under Rule 56.01(d) requires 225 to
demonstrate that it appears there is good reason
to believe that SIC does not have sufficient assets in Ontario or a
reciprocating jurisdiction to satisfy a costs award (Georgian
Windpower Corp. v. Stelco Inc., [2012] O.J. No. 158 (ONSC) at
para. 7; Coastline at para. 7). This is not a heavy onus and only
requires 225 to establish that there is more than conjecture, hunch or
speculation (Mazzika Arbika Ltd. v. Aviva Insurance Company of
Canada, 2017 ONSC 6801 at paras. 21-27; Amelin Resources Inc., LLC v.
Victory Energy Operations, LLC, 2022 ONSC 4514 at paras. 17-18).
[13]             
I am satisfied that 225 has met the light onus that there is good reason
to believe that SIC does not have sufficient assets to satisfy a costs award.
SIC has not operated for over 5 years and its banking and financial
documentation supports the conclusion that it does not have sufficient assets.
I reject SIC’s submission that the court should not give weight to the banking and
financial information because it is outdated. It was open to SIC to file updated
financial information or other evidence to demonstrate that even though it has
not operated a business in over 5 years, its financial circumstances have improved
since 2019 such that it now has sufficient assets. It has not done so. The fact
that SIC advises that it is funding this litigation does not on its own alter
this conclusion.
[14]             
SIC submits that it would be unjust to order security for
costs because it is impecunious and its claim is not plainly devoid of merit. In
my view, SIC has not met the heavy onus to establish that it is impecunious.
This would require the court to find that, even beyond its assets, SIC cannot raise the necessary funds to post security (Paulus v. Murray, 2007
CanLII 6904 at para. 5). A corporate party must not only establish
that the corporation itself is impecunious, but that it cannot raise funds from
its shareholders to do so (2311888 Ontario Inc. v. Ross, 2017
ONSC 1295 at para. 20). A corporation asserting
impecuniosity must provide evidence of its financial circumstances with “robust
particularity” including complete and accurate disclosure of income, assets,
expenses, liabilities and borrowing ability with supporting documentation for
each category (Ross at paras. 18-19). There must be more than some
evidence of impecuniosity and the court must be satisfied that it is genuinely impecunious with
full and frank disclosure of its financial circumstances (Montrose Hammond
& Co. v. CIBC World Markets Inc., 2012 ONSC 4869 at paras. 34-35;
EBA Advertising Inc. v. Kahn
(c.o.b. Taxi Taxi Co.), 2013 ONSC 4971).
[15]             
Based on the record, SIC has not made sufficient disclosure to
conclude that it is impecunious. SIC has not filed any evidence regarding its
ability to raise funds from its principals and shareholders including whether
Ms. Scott has sufficient assets to post security. There is also no evidence
that SIC has made any inquiries or attempts to borrow funds from third party lenders
and the costs of doing so (Chantrs Blinds and Shutters Inc. v.
2037208 Ontario Inc., 2022 ONSC 6832 at para. 20). Ms.
Scott deposed that she controls and operates a new company in a business
similar to SIC which has an operating line of credit, however, there is no
evidence or information as to whether this line of credit could be used to post
security or if the lender providing the line was asked or would advance funds
for security.
[16]             
As I have not concluded that SIC is impecunious, SIC
must demonstrate that its Counterclaim has a good chance of
success or a real possibility of success (Coastline at paras. 3 and 7; Chalhal
v. Abdullah et al, 2022 ONSC 1727 at paras. 47-50; Chill Media Inc. v.
Brewers Retail Inc., 2021 ONSC 1296 at para. 14).  In considering the
merits, the court is not required to embark on an analysis such as on a summary
judgment motion (Coastline at para. 7; Horizon Entertainment Cargo
Ltd. v. Marshall, 2019 ONSC 2081 at para. 3). The court’s consideration of the merits is based primarily on the
pleadings with recourse to evidence filed on the motion
and if the case is complex or turns on credibility, it is generally not
appropriate to make an assessment of the merits at the interlocutory stage (Coastline
at para. 7; Horizon at para. 3). An assessment of the merits should only be decisive where the merits may be
properly assessed on an interlocutory application and success or failure
appears obvious (Coastline at
para. 7; Horizon
at para. 3).
[17]             
In my view, it is not possible to conclude on the
record before me that SIC’s Counterclaim has a good chance
or real possibility of success. There are numerous disputed
issues of fact and law and issues of credibility which must be determined.
These include SIC’s allegations that 245 made fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations
with respect to the HVAC; that 245’s alleged conduct with respect to the HVAC denied
SIC quiet enjoyment and resulted in disruptions to SIC’s business which,
together with the Lease termination, caused SIC to lose sales and profits both
during and after the tenancy and the Amoena agreement and ultimately caused the
termination of its business, or, if SIC was not profitable due to other factors;
that 245 acted in bad faith; and that 245 breached SIC’s right to renew the
Lease. These issues can only be properly determined on a complete record at
trial or a summary judgment motion, not on the limited record at this
interlocutory stage.
[18]             
Similarly, I reject SIC’s argument that it would be unjust to order
security because any insufficiency of SIC’s assets was caused by 245’s actionable
conduct complained of in the Counterclaim (John Wink Ltd. v. Sico
Inc., 1987 CanLII 4299 (ON SC); Cigar500.com Inc. v. Ashton
Distributions Inc., 2009 CanLII 46451 (ON SC), [2009] O.J. No. 3680 (S.C.J.) at para. 40; at paras.
21-27). Again, there are multiple, significant issues of disputed fact,
particularly with respect to SIC’s allegations that 245’s conduct in
terminating the Lease and with respect to the HVAC was the cause or primary
cause of the loss of profits and its business as opposed to other causes
unrelated to 245.
[19]             
SIC also argues that 245’s delay in bringing this motion precludes an
order for security (Chalhal at paras. 33, 51-55; Wilson Young &
Associates v. Carleton University et al, 2020 ONSC 4542 at para.
59). A motion for security for costs must be brought promptly upon the
Defendant discovering that it has a reasonable basis for bringing the motion as
a plaintiff should not have to post security after it has incurred significant
expense in advancing the litigation (Wilson Young at para. 59). The
moving party should not be entitled to security for costs if its delay causes
prejudice to the plaintiff and failure to explain the delay is fatal to the
motion even in the absence of prejudice (Wilson Young at para. 59).
[20]             
To a certain degree, I accept SIC’s submissions on timing. 245 submits
that it first became aware of SIC’s financial difficulties when it received
SIC’s banking and financial statements in satisfaction of answers to
undertakings on September 16, 2022.  245 did not raise any concerns with SIC’s
counsel until September 8, 2023 and did not bring this motion until January 15,
2024. I agree that it could have been brought sooner though not before
discoveries as SIC asserts. However, I cannot conclude that the timing of 245’s
motion is strategic or that SIC would suffer material prejudice due to the
timing (Wilson at para. 59; Yaiguage at para. 23). I conclude
that the delay should be reflected in the amount and terms of security, including
by limiting security to future steps in the litigation due to 245’s willingness
to participate in the litigation without security.
[21]             
I also do not accept SIC’s submission that no security should be ordered
because it is in respect of a counterclaim which is a defence that could have
been asserted by way of set off. It is an
established principle that a party should not have to post security for costs as a condition of defending itself and where the facts on which a counterclaim is
based are largely the same facts and circumstances raised
in the plaintiff’s claim, this militates against an order for security (Paramount
Franchise Group, 2022 ONSC 4533 at para. 11). Whether a
plaintiff by counterclaim should be ordered to post security is a relevant
factor for the court to consider in exercising its discretion (Wilkings v. The Velocity Group Inc., (2008)
89 O.R. (3d) 731 (Div. Ct.) at paras. 23 and 29). The court should consider whether or not the counterclaim is in substance a reiteration
of the plaintiff by counterclaim's defence to the main action and if it is, the court may exercise its
discretion to deny the motion by the defendant by counterclaim that the
plaintiff by counterclaim post security for costs or qualify the amount of
security to otherwise be posted (Wilkings at
para. 29; Acasta v. Acasta, 2023 ONSC 34 at paras. 25-26).
[22]             
In the present case, while some of SIC’s claims are substantially just reiterations
of its defences to 245’s claims, the Counterclaim also raises independent
factual and legal issues which go beyond its defence in both substance and
quantum. Specifically, I am satisfied that SIC’s claims for rent, additional
rent and some maintenance amounts are largely defences to 245’s claim. However,
SIC’s damage claims for lost profits both during and after its tenancy are
multiple times more than 245’s claim and are fundamentally different from the largely
Lease-related issues in the main claims and defences. In my view, this can be
addressed sufficiently through an appropriate reduction in the amount of
security ordered.
[23]             
Applying a holistic approach, I conclude that it is just in the
circumstances to exercise the court’s discretion to order security for costs. Taking
into consideration the relevant factors I am satisfied that an amount can be
ordered on reasonable terms which balances the parties’ interests, namely, one
that is not so onerous as to prevent SIC from asserting its Counterclaim while
providing 245 with some protection from an unenforceable costs award (Chill
Media at para. 14). The justness of the order and the balance between
seeing claims through to trial against the risk of unenforceable costs awards can
and should be reflected in the quantum of security ordered, not simply whether
security is ordered at all (Rosin at paras. 38-39; Lipson at
para. 48). It is also relevant that this is private, commercial litigation with
no public interest considerations in which SIC is claiming damages well in
excess of 245 is claiming. If SIC is successful, its principals stand to benefit
and therefore should accept at least some of the risk of pursuing their claims
(Design 19 Construction Ltd. v. Marks, [2002] O.J. No. 1091 (Ont.
S.C.J.) at paras. 10-15). The courts have held that those who are prepared to
finance the litigation should also be prepared, in the absence of
impecuniosity, to post security (Crudo Creative Inc. v. Marin, 2007 CanLII 60834 (ON SCDC), [2007]
O.J. No. 5334 (Ont. Div.).
[24]             
The court has broad discretion to determine a fair and reasonable amount
of security which is substantially similar to the exercise of its discretion in
fixing costs of a proceeding pursuant to Rule 57.01 (Canadian Metal
Buildings Inc. v. 1467344 Ontario Limited, 2019 ONSC 566 at
para. 27). The quantum should reflect an amount that falls within the
reasonable contemplation of the parties, what the successful defendant would
likely recover and the factors set out in Rule 57.01 (720441 Ontario Inc. v.
The Boiler et al, 2015 ONSC 4841 at para. 56; Marketsure
Intermediaries Inc. v. Allianz Insurance Co. of Canada, 2003
CarswellOnt 1906 at paras. 17-20). In most cases, security for costs will be
ordered on a partial indemnity scale in tranches by stage(s) in the litigation on a "pay as
you go" basis (Marketsure at paras. 13-18).
[25]             
In determining a fair and reasonable amount, there is no reason to
depart from the general rule that security for costs should be ordered on a
partial indemnity scale. I am satisfied that the amount of $45,000 sought by
245 must be reduced to reflect numerous factors. This includes the timing of the
motion and 245’s willingness to proceed without security until this stage of
the litigation notwithstanding earlier knowledge of SIC’s financial
difficulties. Consistent with my conclusions above regarding SIC’s claims
asserted in the Counterclaim, a reduction is also necessary to exclude amounts
related to SIC’s defence and to account for the inevitable overlap and
economies of scale associated with the Counterclaim. I have also taken into
consideration the fact that this proceeding is under the Simplified Rules and
to provide for more reasonable costs expectations. Finally, I also conclude
that it is in the interests of justice, in particular to provide for the
possibility of settlement, that the first instalment of security not be made
until after the action is set down for trial and the second after the Pre-Trial
Conference.
[26]             
Having reviewed 245’s submissions on quantum and considering all of the
factors canvassed above, I am satisfied that it is fair and reasonable, within
the parties’ reasonable expectations and just in the circumstances for SIC to
post security of $25,000 on the following terms: $15,000 within 60 days of the matter
being set down for trial; and $10,000 within 60 days after the Pre-Trial
Conference.
[27]             
Order to go on the terms set out above.
[28]             
If the parties cannot agree on the costs of this motion, they may
file written costs submissions not to exceed 3 pages (excluding Costs Outlines)
on a timetable to be agreed upon by counsel.
