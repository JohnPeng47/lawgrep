[1]              
Arista brings a motion  (the “Annulment
Motion”) to Annul the Consumer Proposal (the “Consumer Proposal”) of
the Consumer Debtor.
[2]              
The Court on this Annulment Motion must
determine whether it should exercise its discretion to annul the Consumer
Proposal in the factual context where BOTH the Consumer Debtor AND the Moving
Party Creditor Arista are in breach of certain of their respective duties under
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, RSC 1985, B-3. (the "BIA”).
[3]              
The Court must determine whether there is a
greater systemic risk to the administration of the Bankruptcy system generally
by condoning the improper behaviour of the Consumer Debtor, or condoning the improper
behaviour of the Moving Party Creditor Arista, or whether there is a resolution
that condones neither.
[4]              
The Consumer Proposal was:
[5]              
The parties initially appeared before me on a
case conference on December 13, 2023 with Arista seeking at least a half day hearing
(the “Case Conference”).
[6]              
After discussion at that case conference, and due
to the less than complete disclosure of the facts by Arisa (as detailed below),
it did not appear to me that the dispute was so fact dense as to require a half
or full day and let the parties appear for 59 minutes on a regular Bankruptcy
Zoom Motions day, after exchanging materials in accordance with the Timetable that
I ordered.
[7]              
On reviewing the materials filed for the Motion for
the return date of June 20, 2024, and after hearing arguments made by Arista at
that hearing, it was apparent to me that Arista had failed to advise the Court
at the Case Conference of certain proceedings that Arista had taken in relation
to the Consumer Debtor and the Administrator without obtaining first obtaining leave
of the Court.
[8]              
Only in the materials filed by Arista and the
Administrator, and in the submissions by Counsel for Arista at the hearing of
the Motion on June 20, 2024, was it revealed to the Court that Arista had:
[9]              
Counsel for Arista admitted at the hearing of
the Annulment Motion  that leave under s.69.4 of the BIA was not obtained by
Arista prior to the commencement of the Arista Newmarket Application, in violation of the provisions of s.69.2 of the BIA the applicable
portions of which read:
[10]          
As the Consumer Proposal was deemed filed on
November 9, 2021 and deemed accepted by operation of s.66.18 of the BIA on
December 24, 2022, and deemed approved by the Court on January 9, 2022, Arista
is in breach of the provisions of s.69.2 by commencing the Newmarket Application
against the Consumer Debtor without first obtaining leave of this Bankruptcy
Court.
[11]          
Similarly, Counsel for Arista admitted at the
hearing that leave under s.215 of the BIA was not obtained by Arista prior to
the commencement of the Arista Administrator Action against KSA, as well as Judd
and Kunjar, in their personal capacities.
[12]          
Section 215 reads:
[13]          
“Trustee” is defined in s.2 of the BIA
[14]          
Under s.66.11 of the BIA:
[15]          
To remove all doubt, s.66.4 of the BIA reads:
[16]          
The purposes of the Stay of Proceedings under
the BIA is set out in the following passage from Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Law of Canada, Fourth Edition, by The Honourable Mr. Justice Lloyd W.
Houlden, Mr. Justice Geoffrey B. Morawetz, and Dr. Janis P. Sarra (“Houlden
& Morawetz”) § 5:278. Stay of Proceedings: Unsecured Creditors:
[17]          
In R. v. Fitzgibbon (1990), 1990 CanLII 102 (SCC), 78 C.B.R.
(N.S.) 193, 1990 CarswellOnt 172 (S.C.C.) (cited above) (“Fitzgibbon”)
the Supreme Court of Canada set out the purposes of the Stay of Proceedings in
the BIA:
[18]          
As a result of the revelation of the existence
of the Newmarket Application and, in particular, the Arista Administrator
Action, I required Arista and the Trustee to file supplementary materials, and
in particular the Notice of Application and the Arista Supplementary Factum,
given the tests for Annulment of a Consumer Proposal set out by my colleague
Associate Justice Rappos in the leading case of Re Singh 2024 CarswellOnt
1526, 2024 ONSC 837, 11 C.B.R. (7th) 400, 169 O.R. (3d) 609, 2024 A.C.W.S. 720
(“Singh”), relied on by all parties at the hearing, and also the
provisions of s.4.2 of the BIA governing the conduct of all participants in
proceedings under the BIA, including Consumer Debtors and Creditors.
[19]          
In response to my June 20 Endorsement Arista
provided the Notice of Application in the Newmarket Application and the
Statement of Claim in the Arista Administrator Action.
[20]          
In the Statement of Claim in the Arista Administrator
Action Arista claims against from  KSA, and personally against Kunjar and Judd:
[21]          
I will deal with the specific time-line of  the
interaction between counsel for Arista and the Administrator later in these Reasons
in the context of the Annulment Motion, but the specific allegations being made
by Arista against the Administrator to support its claims for punitive damages
against KSA, and Kunjar and Judd personally, are very serious:
[22]          
I note that Arista issued the Statement of Claim
in the Arista Administrator Action on December 22, 2023 with Ed Hiutin and Wei
Jiang (“Jiang”) as counsel of record on the Statement of Claim.
[23]          
This was a mere 9 DAYS AFTER the very same Jiang
attended before me at the Case Conference, where he failed to mention AT ALL that
Arista was going to commence an action against the Administrator, and the LIT’s
Kunjar and Judd in their personal capacities, for general and punitive damages
approaching $1 Million, with respect to the same facts on which Arista was
seeking to annul the Consumer Proposal at the Annulment Motion that Arista
brought.
[24]          
Had Jiang deigned to mention to the Court the
intention of Arista to do so, this Motion would not have been heard as a short
zoom motion, and, most particularly, would not have been heard until a motion
for leave was brought by Arista to the Bankruptcy Court under s.215 of the BIA
enabling it to do so.
[25]          
The Toronto Bankruptcy Court had the capacity in
December of 2023 to schedule the hearing of both leave motions under s.69.4 and
s.215 prior to the actual hearing date of the Annulment Motion in June 2024, so
there is no “Court Backlog” excuse available to Arista.
[26]          
Had Jiang also deigned to mention to the Court
at the Case Conference that Arista had already commenced the Newmarket
Application against the Consumer Debtor a year previously on October 3, 2022, again
without first obtaining leave under s.69.4 of the BIA, I would have pointed out
to Arista the following passage Houlden & Morawetz:
[27]          
I would have urged Jiang to very carefully read
the reasons of  Kershman, J. in O’Leary, and their factual applicability
to the Newmarket Application, which at the time of the Case Conference, had
been issued, and no application for leave under s.69.4 had been made by Arista,
for 1 year 2 months and 10 days, and as of the date of these reasons, 2 years 1
month and 19 days.
[28]          
I would also have had to consider whether the
hearing of the Annulment Motion, which required the Administrator to file
responding materials, would prejudice the position of the Administrator, Kunjar
and Judd, and their insurers, in defending the Arista Administrator Action.
[29]          
In the Ontario Court of Appeal in Title v.
Canadian Asset Based Lending Enterprise (CABLE) Inc., 2011 ONCA 715
(CanLII) stated:
[30]          
I would also have directed Jiang to s.197 of the
BIA as well the decision of Newbould, J. in Kaptor Financial Inc. v. SF Partnership,
LLP, 2016 CarswellOnt 17052, 41 C.B.R. (6th) 262, 2016 ONSC 6607 (Ont.
S.C.J. [Commercial List]), the Court of Appeal in Doyle Salewski Inc. v. BDO
Canada Ltd. 2016 CarswellOnt 16195, 2016 ONCA 748, 271 A.C.W.S. (3d) 841,
41 C.B.R. (6th) 169 and my decision Re Bannikova 2023 CarswellOnt 14017,
2023 ONSC 5131, 2023 A.C.W.S. 4499.
[31]          
Given the obvious breaches of duties by Arista
as described above, and later in these reasons, and also allegedly by the
Consumer Debtor, I would also have invited the OSB to determine whether it
wished to intervene at the hearing of the Annulment Motion under the provisions
of s.5(4)(a) of the BIA, given the systemic and policy issues that can arise as
a consequence of the breaches of duties by both the Consumer Debtor and Arista,
or to determine whether the OSB wished to conduct an investigation of the behaviour
of either the Consumer Debtor and Arista, prior to the hearing of the Annulment
Motion.
[32]          
However, Jiang’s material non-disclosure to the
Court prevented me from remedying their persistent non-compliance with the BIA at
some point prior to discovering Arista’s misconduct while reading the court
materials filed for the Annulment Motion in June 2024.
[33]          
I am not deciding the still un-brought leave
motions by Arista in these Reasons.  But the conduct of Arista is very relevant
to the annulment tests in Singh, the exercise by the Court of its
discretion to annul the Consumer Proposal as requested by Arista, and
particularly the determination by the Court under the mandatory provisions of
s.4.2 of the BIA of whether Arista or the Consumer Debtor were acting in good
faith.
[34]          
All underlined and bolded text in these reasons
is emphasis added by me for these reasons.
[35]          
The Court has considered all materials and
arguments raised by all of the parties on this Discharge Hearing. Any failure
by the Court to refer in these reasons to specific arguments and materials
raised does not reflect that the Court has not considered those arguments.
[36]          
Consumer Proposals, since the 2009 amendments to
the BIA increasing the eligible debt limit for Consumer Proposals from $75,000
to $250,000, are, by far, the most commonly used insolvency proceeding in
Canada.
[37]          
In the Insolvency Statistics in Canada—Annual
Report 2023 issued by the OSB, it was reported that of the 123,233 total consumer
insolvency filings in Canada in 2023, 97,017 or 78.7% were Consumer Proposals.
[38]          
The total volume of insolvencies in Canada under
the BIA, not counting CCAA Proceedings were reported as 128,043, including in
that amount 4,810 business (both individual, partnership and corporate)
insolvencies under the BIA, but not including receiverships.
[39]          
There were 64 CCAA proceedings commenced in 2023
in all of Canada, and 474 Receiverships, making them statistically meaningless
insofar as the total number of insolvency filings in Canada in 2023 is
concerned.
[40]          
Thus Proposals filed by consumers constituted by
number 76% of all proceedings commenced under the BIA in 2023, consumer and
business, which compromised in excess of $10 Billion of debts declared by
Consumers in those proposals in 2023.
[41]          
Houlden & Morawetz§ 4:152. Consumer Proposals Generally states the following with
respect to the general policy provisions underlying the Consumer Proposal
provisions of the BIA:
[42]          
The deemed statutory approvals by creditors and
the Court, where objections are not filed with the Administrators within the statutory
time periods, are mandatory and not discretionary on Administrators, and are a
key feature of the Consumer Proposal process intended to lessen administrative
costs in order to increase the efficiency of distributions of smaller amounts
to creditors.
[43]          
This is also facilitated by the fee tariff
imposed under Bankruptcy and Insolvency General Rule 129 for
Administrators of Consumer Proposals (the “BIA Rules”) , to ensure that
professional costs do no reduce amounts payable to creditors.  The Rule reads:
[44]          
In the case of this Consumer Proposal, the
entirety of the fee payable to the Administrator, not including taxes and
counseling fees, would be $1500 plus an additional maximum amount of  $4,800 (20%
of $24,000) if  the Consumer Debtor successfully completed her payments over a
60 month period.

In Jalal 2003 CanLII 64273 (ON SC), 2003 CarswellOnt 1750, 42 C.B.R.
(4th) 260 (“Jalal”) in a situation such as this one, where a later filed
claim caused the consumer proposal to exceed the then $75,000 limit for
aggregate debts that were eligible to be compromised under a consumer proposal
(that since 2009 is now $250,000 under the provisions of s.66.11) Deputy
Registrar Nettie stated:

Peppall, J.J.A. found that claims of creditors with judgments and executions in
Consumer Proposals, such as Arista, are ordinary unsecured claims, with no
priority over other ordinary unsecured creditors:
[50]          
My colleague Associate Justice Rappos in Singh
summarized the statutory regime for Consumer Proposals:
[51]          
Also in Singh, after the review of the
prior authorities, Associate Justice Rappos comprehensively synthesized from
that prior jurisprudence the following test for annulment of a Consumer
Proposal:
[52]          
The Bankrupt is a first time Consumer Debtor and
has never been Bankrupt.
[53]          
On this Annulment Motion the Administrator has
filed a Report dated August 2, 2024 (the “Report”) attaching the Creditors
Package sent to all creditors, including Arista, both directly and through its
counsel at Exhibit “C” (the “Creditors Package”).
[54]          
The Consumer Debtor on November 9, 2021 filed
the Consumer Proposal dated November 8, 2021 with the Administrator, and the
Administrator filed it with the OSB according to the OSB Certificate at Exhibit
B to the Report.  Therefore the starting date for all time periods in this
Consumer Proposal estate is November 9, 2021.
[55]          
From the Creditors Package it appears that Arista
was sent the Creditors Package directly by mail on November 12, 2021 to “600
Applewood Crescent Vaughn ON L4K 4B4”, and again the same day at 2:35 PM by
email to email address “homecare@artistahomes.com.”
[56]          
Counsel for Arista, appearing on this Annulment
Motion, was also sent the Creditor’s Package by mail on November 12, 2021 to
the Attention of Ed Hiutin at “200-7501 Keele St. Vaughan ON L4K 1Y2”, and also
by fax at 7:54 PM the same day to “1-416-599-7910”.
[57]          
In support of the Annulment Motion Arista filed the
Affidavit of Vijay Perinparajah, sworn May 31, 2023 (the “Arista Affidavit”). 
At Exhibit K to the Arista Affidavit is an email dated November 17, 2021 at
1:43 PM from Jiang to the Administrator’s general email box (the “Arista
November 17 Email”) attaching the Creditors Package and stating:
[58]          
So it is clear, and not denied in the Arista
Affidavit, that Arista and its counsel were aware of the Consumer Proposal on
November 17, 2021. What they did with that knowledge is the crucial issue on
this Annulment Motion.  The implications of their conduct must be considered in
the context of how Consumer Proposals are to function.
[59]          
As set in the general policy section, Consumer
Proposals are intended to deal with smaller debts, in less complicated
situations, in a cost efficient fashion.
[60]          
As a result the policy choice was made to
dispense with many of the procedural features of Division I Proposals, such as multiple
mailings to creditors, mandatory creditors meetings and applications for Court
Approval, and for consumer proposals to utilize simplified statutorily mandated
precedent materials and rigid procedures.
[61]          
 All of this is intended to reduce the administrative
friction and expense in estates where by definition, the amounts payable under
the proposals tend to be less than the limit for Consumer Proposal of $250,000
in declared debts.  This is done in an effort to maximize the realization to
creditors from the amount paid by the Consumer Debtor under the Consumer
Proposal.
[62]          
The actual “Proposal Materials” and Creditors
Packages are not drafted as independent documents as they would be in a
Division I Proposal.
[63]          
Instead they are usually generated in the Insolvency
Estate Management software used by LIT Administrators, using the forms
statutorily mandated by the BIA and the OSB, and the data populated throughout
the package at intake when provided in the initial interviews with the Consumer
Debtor.
[64]          
In the case of the Creditors Package in this
estate that was sent to Arista by the Administrator included:
[65]          
By design each of these documents are very brief
and simple, and are intended for use by creditors that will be unlikely to
retain counsel to deal with the Consumer Proposal due to the practicalities of
the costs and benefits, in order to implement the policy objectives and
efficiencies of the Consumer Proposal Process.
[66]          
Accordingly, each document is replete with
instructions and warnings to creditors about the time periods that they need to
respond in order to be permitted to participate in decision making under the
Consumer Proposal.
[67]          
In its entirety, this Consumer Proposal by this
Consumer Debtor reads:
[68]          
The CP Report reads, in its entirety:
[69]          
Most importantly, the relevant portions of the 1
page Notice to Creditors has the following statements, instructions and
warnings to the creditors receiving it, including, admittedly,  Arista
(emphasis mine):
[70]          
The “Checklist for Proofs of Claim” attached to
the Creditors Package by the Administrator, which appears in the Arista Affidavit
at Exhibit J, warns creditors specifically (emphasis mine):
[71]          
It should be noted that the time periods and
statements in this Notice by this Administrator are in the statutorily mandated
form language, and in accordance with provisions of s.66.15, 66.18 and 66.22 of
the BIA which reads:
[72]          
So the deemed creditor acceptance of the
Consumer Proposal occurs under s.66.18 if the OSB or sufficient creditors with
PROVEN claims do not properly request a meeting under s.66.15 within 45 days of
the date of the filing of the Consumer Proposal.
[73]          
In this case that date for creditors with PROVEN
claims to request a meeting was December 24th, 2021.
[74]          
The deemed Court Approval under s.66.22 occurs
if there is deemed, or actual creditor approval, if a meeting of creditors was
properly requested, AND if the OSB or creditors do not request the
Administrator to apply for a Court review within 15 days of the date of deemed
or actual creditor Approval.
[75]          
In this case that date for the OSB or creditors to
request a Court Review was January 8th, 2022.
[76]          
The key issue for this Annulment Motion, as well
as the allegations made by Arista in the Arista Administrator Action, is
whether the interactions that Arista had with the Administrator constituted
either a request for a meeting in accordance with s.66.18 and/or a Court Review
in accordance with s.66.22.
[77]          
The Consumer Debtor listed Arista on the
Statement of Affairs care of its counsel at $0.  The other creditors listed
were Capital One Mastercard at $900, MBNA at $9500 and TD Canada Trust at $9000
for a total of $19,400 in claims declared by the Consumer Debtor.
[78]          
As set out in the claims register issued by the
Administrator on January 17, 2024, attached to the Notice of Creditors
Acceptance and deemed Court Approval sent to the Consumer Debtor by the
Administrator at Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Malbow Santhikumar sworn on
January 24th, 2024 (the “Consumer Debtor Affidavit”), only one creditor -
Melvin Mariathas, who was not initially listed on the Statement of Affairs,
filed a proof of claim in the Consumer Proposal in the amount of $1000 that was
admitted.
[79]          
As at January 17, 2024 the claim of Arista was
still “Not Proved” and had a “SOA” amount of $1.00.
[80]          
The Consumer Proposal offered creditors $24,000
over 60 months at $400 per month.
[81]          
The asset values reported by the Consumer Debtor
in the Statement of Affairs, and the realization values as at September 18,
2007 were:
[82]          
Arista filed a Proof of Claim (the “Arista
Proof of Claim”) on January 19, 2022 with the Administrator.  The email
that attached the Arista Proof of Claim was sent at 1:18 PM by Vijay
Perinparajah, a law clerk (the “Arista January 19 Email”) is
attached at Exhibit L to the Arista Affidavit and stated:
[83]          
Exhibit L to the Arista Affidavit does not
attach the Proof of Claim, the Affidavit of Wei Jiang or the Proxy. In fact the
Proof of Claim of Arista is nowhere in the Motion Record served on the
Annulment Motion by Arista.
[84]          
Fortunately for Arista, the Administrator
included the Arista Proof of Claim, as Exhibit F to the Report.
[85]          
The Arista Proof of Claim is for the amount of
$451,710.12 and the details are “pls see attached affidavit”.
[86]          
However the Arista Affidavit sets out in some
detail the nature of the Arista claim against the Consumer Debtor:
[87]          
The Default Judgment of Justice Bird dated
December 17, 2020 (the “Arista Judgment”)  is at Exhibit G to the Arista
Affidavit is in the amount of $402,574.12 plus $5,284.59 in costs with
post-judgment interest of 12% commencing December 17, 2020. It appears from the
FRANK Court record that the Motion for the Default Judgment against the
Consumer Debtor was filed by Arista on December 7, 2020.
[88]          
In the Affidavit of Wei Jiang attached to the
Proof of Claim (the “Arista Proof of Claim Affidavit”) the amount
claimed is $451,710.12, but nowhere is there an explanation of how the amount
of the Arista Judgment was arrived at, given that the Statement of Claim in
Newmarket Action CV-18-00138380 (the “Arista Action”)  at Exhibit A to
that Affidavit the original claim against the Consumer Debtor was for the
amount of $1,269,990.
[89]          
Presumably there was a resale of the property
which the Consumer Debtor signed an agreement of purchase and sale for, but
failed to close, but there is no explanation of that in the Arista Proof of
Claim Affidavit.
[90]          
There is also no explanation of whether the
co-defendant under the  Krishnaveni Manoranjan “Manoranjan”) paid any
amount under the Arista Judgment.  It appears from the Court FRANK record for
the Arista Action that Arista obtained Writs of Seizure and Sale against both
Defendants on January 18, 2021 and also had issued a Notice of Garnishment against
Manoranjan on February 4, 2021, the same day as the issuance of Notice of
Garnishment against the Consumer Debtor. It also appears that Arista obtained
an Order from Justice Dawe against Manoranjan alone on February 25th,
2020, for substituted service.
[91]          
Did Arista ever collect anything from Manoranjan? 
Arista provides no evidence and neither does the Consumer Debtor or the  Administrator.
[92]          
It appears from the Court FRANK records for the
Arista Action that a “Notice of Bankruptcy” was filed with the Court with
respect to Manoranjan on March 24th, 2021.  It appears from the OSB
records that A. Farber  was appointed as Trustee in Bankruptcy of Manoranjan on
March 9, 2021 and that a stay of proceedings under s.69.3 of the BIA of the
Arista Judgment against Manoranjan was imposed on that date.  The estate number
is 31-2718653.  This was a summary administration bankruptcy estate and the
Trustee A. Farber was discharged in March of 2023.
[93]          
Under the provisions of R.11 of the Civil Rules
the Arista Action was stayed upon the Bankruptcy of Manoranjan on March 9, 2021
and no further step in that proceeding could be taken under an Order to
continue was obtained to comply with R.11.  None was obtained by Arista.
[94]          
Why was this not disclosed anywhere in any
materials filed with the Court by Arista, but most particularly in the Arista
Affidavit and the Arista Proof of Claim Affidavit?
[95]          
Did Arista file a proof of claim in the
bankruptcy of Manoranjan?  Was Arista paid a dividend in that Manoranjan Bankruptcy
that Arista had a duty to disclose in the Arista Proof of Claim and the Arista
Proof of Claim Affidavit under the provisions of s.201 of the BIA?
[96]          
If Manoranjan had paid any amounts under the
Arista Judgment, was this reflected in the Arista Proof of Claim, and was A.
Farber the Trustee of Manoranjan aware that Arista was also pursuing the
Consumer Debtor as co-defendant.
[97]          
All of the relevant direct evidence provided by
the Consumer Debtor in the Consumer Debtor Affidavit was:
[98]          
However, given that the Consumer Debtor served a
Notice of Intent to Defend in April of 2019, but never served a Defence, it
appears she was aware of the Action by Arista prior to the Noting in Default in
June of 2019.  I note that the Notice of Intent to Defend served by the
Consumer Debtor on counsel for Arista specifically states specifically the
following:
[99]          
How the Consumer Debtor could state that in her
Notice of Intent to Defend in 2019 and now state 5 years later in the Consumer
Debtor Affidavit “…but I did not reside at 89 Guinevere Road, Markham, Ontario,
and never received any mail” is unknown.
[100]      
However I do note that on the documentation for
the purchase of the property that are attached at Exhibit A to the Arista Affidavit,
the address provided by the Consumer Debtor to Arista on or about April 11,
2017 (when the purchase documents were signed) is the 111 Bethany Leigh Drive
address, which is the subject matter of the Newmarket Application, while the
address for Manoranjan is 89 Guinevere Crescent. For whatever reason in the
Arista Statement of Claim the address for service provided for both the
Consumer Debtor and Manoranjan is the 89 Guinevere address.
[101]      
So there may have been some initial confusion,
but it appears the Statement of Claim came to the sufficient attention of the
Consumer Debtor by June of 2019 to prompt her to serve a Notice of Intent to
Defend (It does not appear from the Court FRANK record for that the Notice of
Intent to Defend was ever filed with the Court.).  Based on the evidence of the
Consumer Debtor that the Notice of Garnishment was sent to the 111 Bethany
Leigh Drive address in the spring of 2021, it is clear that at that point
Arista knew where she lived.
[102]      
If there were service issues it appears that
they were sufficiently resolved to have the Consumer Debtor aware of the Action
by Arista in sufficient time to file a defence to avoid a default judgment.  To
raise the issue 5 years later is too late.
[103]      
There is no dispute by any party that the Arista
Proof of Claim was only received by the Administrator on January 19, 2022, AFTER
the deemed acceptance of the Consumer Proposal by the Creditors, and deemed
approval by the Court.
[104]      
Arista admits that it received the Creditors
Package on or about November 17, 2021 and the Jiang Email from that date
substantiates that Arista, by its counsel, was aware of the specific instructions
and warnings contained in the statutorily prescribed forms regarding the
consequences of not properly requesting a meeting, not filing a proof of claim,
and not requesting a review under the strict terms of the BIA.
[105]      
Any Creditor who wishes to participate in any
kind of insolvency proceeding under the BIA must file Proof of Claim in
accordance with the BIA. This was not something dreamt up by the Administrator
to inconvenience Arista and its counsel, it is a cornerstone principal under
the BIA,  whether or not they had obtained the Arista Judgment.
[106]      
 Section 135 requires that creditor, MUST prove
their claims, whether or not they already have a judgment against the debtor or
Bankrupt.  The section reads:
[107]      
Houlden & Morawetz § 6:144. Necessity for Filing Proof of Claim—Generally summarizes
this requirement:
[108]      
In Re Hayre, 2014 CarswellBC 2625, 2014
BCSC 1672, [2014] B.C.W.L.D. 6931, 244 A.C.W.S. (3d) 521 Registrar Nielsen
stated:
[109]      
Houlden & Morawetz states at § 6:24. Requirements for Proof of Claim—Generally:
[110]      
In Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v.
433616 Ontario Inc. 1993 CarswellOnt 193, 17 C.B.R.
(3d) 160, 38 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1086 McWilliam, J. underlines that the onus is on
the creditor to prove its claim, in order to participate in proceedings under
the BIA:
[111]      
In response to the Arista November 17 Email the
staff of the Administrator sent the following email to counsel for Arista:  (Exhibit E to the Report)
[112]      
Apparently there was no communication with
counsel for Arista in response to this timely email from the Administrator, and
the next email to the Administrator from counsel for Arista is found in all of
the materials before the Court is the Arista January 19 Email attaching the
Arista Proof of Claim that I excerpted above.
[113]      
As noted, this was sent by counsel for Arista
AFTER the Consumer Proposal was deemed accepted by the Creditors and approved
by the Court under the BIA because no creditor, particularly Arista, had:
[114]      
As I have pointed out in detail, Arista was
provided with the Creditor’s Package enclosing the documents in the proper statutorily
mandated forms, replete with warnings of the statutory time periods for filing
claims and requesting a meeting, and the consequences for not doing so, and
were then specifically told by the Administrator what they needed to do by a
responding email from the Administrator 26 MINUTES after the Arista November 17
Email.
[115]      
And yet Arista and its counsel did nothing for 63
DAYS until the January 19 Email, when the statutory time periods had already expired
and the Consumer Proposal was deemed approved by the creditors and the Court by
operation of the BIA.
[116]      
There then ensued a dialogue between the
Administrator and Arista where the Administrator attempted to explain the
Consumer Proposal provisions of the BIA, to which counsel for Arista was
unreceptive.
[117]      
After prompts from a law clerk working for
Counsel for Arista on January 31 and February 4, 2022, the Administrator on February
4, 2022 (Exhibit G to the Report):
[118]      
The Administrator sent a Material Change Report under
s.66.251 dated February 7, 2022 to the creditors which stated:
[119]       
Counsel for Arista
responded with belligerence. In a series of emails at Exhibit I to the Report between
Jiang and (ultimately) Judd between February 7, 2022 and February 9, 2022 Jiang
took assorted positions that were wrong at law:
[120]      
As I have set out above, and as summarized by
Associate Justice Rappos in Singh, the Consumer Proposal was not invalid
merely because the claims of creditors exceeded the $250,000, otherwise there
would have been no reason for Associate Justice Rappos to have had to decide Singh.
 So Jiang was incorrect.
[121]      
Also, despite all the above ex-post facto
fist-shaking and arm-waving by Jiang, and despite being previously “pretty-pleased”
to file a proof of claim by the Administrator on November 17, 2021 at 2:08 PM,
Arista failed to file a proof of claim for another 63 days, as the statutory
deeming time periods expired, one after another after another.
[122]      
Without the proof of claim being filed, Arista
had no standing to request a meeting, and no ability to receive dividends from
the Consumer Proposal, notwithstanding the magical properties that Jiang
attributed to the Arista Judgment.
[123]      
The statements by Jiang in the above emails:
[124]      
Without a proof of claim substantiating the
amounts payable under the Judgment, and providing all payments already
received, merely sending a copy of a judgment by email is not sufficient to
prove the claim. As will be seen, it is particularly a problematic position in
this case as there are many questions that the Court has regarding the Arista
Claim, arising from material non-disclosure by Arista.
[125]      
The BIA clearly states, as set out in detail in Singh,
and in s.66.13(4) that deemed acceptance in these circumstances is NOT a
nullity only because debts exceed $250,000.
[126]      
The Administrator had no power under the BIA to
“revoke” the Consumer Proposal after deemed acceptance.  The Debtor had the
power to withdraw the Consumer Proposal, or it could be annulled by Order of
the Court.
[127]      
The reason this Annulment Motion has been
brought, is that Arista failed to file a Proof of Claim within the statutory
time periods, having admittedly had knowledge of the Consumer Proposal, and
despite being prompted by the Administrator directly to file a Proof of Claim,
and then Arista engaged in a variety of other hyper-aggressive tactics that
also did not fulfil it’s duties as a Creditor under the BIA.
[128]      
After the interchange above, Jiang tried a
different tack, alleging on February 9, 2022 that the Consumer Proposal should
be annulled because the Consumer Debtor had allegedly made a fraudulent
conveyance:
[129]      
At this point the Administrator sends the requested
Trust Agreement to Jiang, and it is the evidence of the Administrator in the
Report that the chronology of this Annulment Motion proceeded as follows:
[130]      
Arista summarized its claim that the
transactions involving the 111 Bethany Leigh Drive Property (the “Bethany
Property”) constituted Fraudulent Conveyances in the Newmarket Application,
issued  October 3, 2022 , or   7 ½ months after receiving the Trust Agreement
from Judd (the “Bethany Transactions”).
[131]      
In the Newmarket Application Arista Alleges:
[132]      
Curiously, the Notice of Application fails to
say when the conveyance occurred. Also curiously the Newmarket Application asks
the Civil Court in Newmarket to grant relief that is in the jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Court in Toronto, but never sought leave of the Bankruptcy Court to
lift the stay prior to issuing the Newmarket Application.
[133]      
The Arista Affidavit, sworn by a law clerk, provides
the following evidence regarding the alleged fraudulent conveyance:
[134]      
Curiously, the Arista Affidavit does not attach
the contemporaneous version of the “Parcel Register” that the law clerk says he
obtained or the date on which he “…conducted a search for any property owned by
Santhikumar”, which would tend to establish whether or not Arista was aware of
the Bethany Transactions prior to the Consumer Proposal.  The parcel register
at Exhibit S to the Arista Affidavit was order by an “lenglish” on August 24,
2021.
[135]      
In  the Administrator’s Report on this Motion
the Administrator reported:
[136]      
The Administrator’s description and analysis of
the Bethany Transactions in the Report to Creditors was admittedly within the
knowledge of Arista and its counsel from on or about November 17, 2021.
[137]      
Whatever the actual import of the allegations of
the making of a fraudulent conveyance by the Consumer Debtor, Arista cannot say
that it was not on notice of the making of that transaction at least by the
admitted receipt of the Creditors Package on or about November 17, 2021, well
within the time periods for Arista to file a proof of claim, request in writing
a creditors meeting after proving its claim, request a copy of the Trust
Agreement it ended up requesting in February 2022, and if not successful in
rejecting the Consumer Proposal at the Creditors Meeting, in person or by
proxy, requesting a Court Review of the Proposal.
[138]      
But from the 17th of November 2021
onward it is clear on the evidence before me at this Motion that Arista had
been put on notice of the Bethany Transactions. As the Bethany Transaction is
summarized in the Creditors Package, the allegation that this was a hidden
transaction, cannot be sustained from that date forward at least.
[139]      
I have also excerpted the entirety of the
relevant direct evidence of the Consumer Debtor in the Consumer Debtor
Affidavit above.  The Consumer Debtor was not cross-examined on that affidavit. 
The Consumer Debtor provided no evidence in the Consumer Debtor’s Affidavit relating
to the Bethany Transactions.
[140]      
No explanation is provided by the Consumer
Debtor as to why the date of the Bethany Transactions of November 9 and 10 2020
was almost exactly one year prior to the date the Consumer Proposal being filed
on November 9, 2021. There was no evidence before me whether the Consumer
Debtor first met with a for-profit debt counselor and received structuring
advice, prior to filing the Consumer Proposal.
[141]      
It is unclear from the following wording in the
Arista Affidavit WHEN Jiang wrote to the Consumer Debtor, but presumably wrote after
advising the Administrator in September 2022 they would be bringing this Annulment
Motion, or almost a year after being advised of the Bethany Transactions in the
Creditor’s Package:
[142]      
Documents are attached at Exhibit “T” to the Arista
Affidavit, received by counsel for Arista from the Consumer Debtor, without any
explanation in the affidavit as to their relevance or context to the
allegations being made as grounds to annul the Consumer Proposal.  They appear
to be 34 pages of transaction documents, email communications and settlement
documents, involving  the Consumer Debtor and her spouse and co-respondent on
the Newmarket Application Branavan Kumar:
[143]      
With respect to Rathiruby’s mortgage being
default, the Arista Affidavit states:
[144]      
That is 35 days after the Arista received the Creditors
Package and was asked by the Administrator to file a Proof of Claim, and only 31
½ hours from the date on which the Consumer Proposal was deemed approved by the
operation of s.66.18 of the BIA, because Arista had failed to file a Proof of
Claim, and then failed to request a meeting of creditors in writing as a Proven
Creditor.
[145]      
Also there is no mention in the Arista Affidavit
as to whether Rathiruby completed her threatened power of sale of the Bethany
Property, or whether the first mortgagee Haventree Bank stepped in, which would
make the Newmarket Application likely moot, and which would tend to also
invalidate the argument that the alleged fraudulent conveyance of the Bethany
Property in the Bethany Transactions was grounds for annulling the Consumer
Proposal.
[146]      
Rathiruby would have been an unaffected secured
creditor under the terms of the Consumer Proposal, and would appear to have
priority over unsecured creditors like Arista over the proceeds of sale of the
Bethany Property.
[147]      
It is also possible that both Haventree Bank and
Rathiruby could have unsecured shortfall claims against the Consumer Debtor
depending on the sale price obtained for the Bethany Property, and the amounts
currently owing on their mortgages.
[148]      
Given the factual density of these documents produced
by the Consumer Debtor to Arista, and that they tend not to support the theory
that the Bethany Transactions were intended by the Consumer Debtor to defeat
creditors, and in particular Arista, the Court would have expected that Arista
would mention in their submissions the problems these documents create for
their case that the Consumer Proposal should be annulled.  They did not.
[149]      
As an example, based on the Parcel Register at
Exhibit R to the Arista Affidavit, Rathiruby appeared to peaceably own the entirety
of the Bethany Property from November 25th, 2011 until July 30, 2019
when she appeared to transfer an interest to Kumar. This was about a month
after the Consumer Debtor, the spouse of Kumar, served a Notice of Intent to
Defend.  Then on November 8, 2020 the Bethany Transactions occur giving the
Bankrupt an registered interest in all of the Bethany Property.
[150]      
Both of these transactions occurred after the Consumer
Debtor was aware that Arista was suing her for over $1 Million because she had
served her Notice of Intent to Defend.  One would have thought that, knowing
this, the Consumer Debtor would not have gone on title to the Bethany Property,
in any way.
[151]      
Arista argued in its facta there was no other
explanation than an intention to defeat creditors, but there are plenty of
other explanations stated in just the documents that Arista attached at Exhibit
T to the Arista Affidavit.
[152]      
In particular, it would appear that Rathiruby,
if deposed by any party with respect to the contents of those documents and the
circumstances of their creation, would provide a transcribed earful of relevant
evidence of her intentions in these transactions, and the motivations for the
Bethany Transactions on the part of the Consumer Debtor and Kumar.
[153]      
Also, why would Rathiruby agree to a transaction
that would put her formerly 100% owned property at risk to the Arista Action? If
she had not made the transfer to the Consumer Debtor and Kumar of her remaining
interest in the Bethany Property in the Bethany Transactions, Arista would have
absolutely no basis to claim against that property as owned by Rathiruby and
Kumar, neither of which Arista otherwise had any claims against.
[154]      
The statement in paragraph 30 of the Arista
Factum:
[155]      
To be clear, I am not deciding the Newmarket
Application, but Arista chose to make the allegations that the Bethany
Transactions were intended to defeat creditors, and in particular Arista, a
factual cornerstone of their motion to annul the Consumer Proposal.
[156]      
They specifically argued in their Facta, that
the annulment is necessary so that they pursue their fraudulent conveyance
claim in the Newmarket Application, despite commencing that proceeding without
leave, and despite taking no steps whatsoever to obtain leave nunc pro tunc
in the 801 days that have elapsed since they commenced the Newmarket
Application in clear breach of the stay provisions of the BIA.
[157]      
Since they raised that issue, it needs to be
dealt with in this context to determine whether the Court ought to exercise its
discretion to annul the Consumer Proposal.
[158]      
However it is also clear from that position of
the Consumer Debtor that under the terms of the unregistered Trustee Agreement
she is a mere bare trustee of the interest of Kumar in the Bethany Property for
the benefit of Kumar as beneficiary, is not congruent with the state of
registered title to the Bethany Property.
[159]      
This leads to the obvious issue as to whether
the mortgagees of the property which were Haventree Bank and Rathiruby were
aware of the existence of the Trust Agreement when they made advances to the
Consumer Debtor and Kumar, and whether the enforceability and priority of their
mortgages are affected by this unregistered instrument allegedly affecting
title.   Another question is whether they are even aware of the Newmarket
Application seeking to declare the transaction that they funded, and involving
their collateral, to be a fraudulent conveyance.
[160]      
Another issue is whether they are aware that one
of their borrowers has filed a Consumer Proposal, as neither was declared on
the Statement of Affairs by the Consumer Debtor.  The Consumer Proposal is not
being made to secured creditors, but both Haventree and Rathiruby are at least
contingent unsecured creditors of the Consumer Debtor that should have been
given notice of the Consumer Proposal.  At the very least the Newmarket
Application and/or the Consumer Proposal could be events of default under the
terms of either of their mortgages.
[161]      
As a starting point, the sections of the BIA relevant
in this case to the annulment of Consumer Proposals read:
[162]      
All parties referred to the leading case of Singh
in their argument and I will structure the analysis using the various tests
articulated by Associate Justice Rappos in that case.
[163]      
Factually, Singh differed from this case,
as in that case the consumer proposal was approved by creditors at an actual
meeting in December 2019, was fully performed by payment of all amounts payable
by the Consumer Debtor in 2023, and the Administrator was discharged in 2023.  Singh
identified $81,555 in unsecured claims and a $60,000 contingent CRA claim on
his statement of affairs.
[164]      
At the meeting of creditors, $136,833.54 in
proven claims voted, including a $75,596.40 CRA proven claim.  CRA voted in
favour of the consumer proposal and all 6 other proven creditors voted against. 
CRA had sufficient votes to approve the Singh consumer proposal despite the
opposition.
[165]      
Singh’s father-in-law obtained default judgment against
Singh in April of 2019, prior to the consumer proposal, in the amount of almost
$92,000 and registered writs against Singh. This debt was not declared on the
statement of affairs by Singh and his father-in-law was unaware of the consumer
proposal.
[166]      
The father in law’s evidence was that he found
out about the consumer proposal in June of 2023 after it had been fully
performed.  He brought the annulment motion a month later in July of 2023.
[167]      
Singh claimed that he was not aware of the
default judgment in favour of his father in law and would have disputed it
anyway.
[168]      
As at March 2023 the dividend sheet prepared by Singh’s
Administrator showed $162,326 in proven creditor claims receiving payment of
$35,373.23 in dividends.  With the addition of his father-in-law’s judgment the
total claims amounted to $251,179.38, exceeding the $250,000 threshold.
[169]      
The Singh situation is by far the more
common factual “did not disclose” situation than this case.
[170]      
One key issue on this motion is whether the
Consumer Debtor by advising the Administrator of the claim of Arista, but not
its quantum, breached her duties under the BIA, and that the Consumer Proposal
should be annulled as demanded by Arista.
[171]      
The Bankrupt’s evidence in its entirety on this
issue was that she found out about the claim when her bank account got
garnished and did not know the details of the judgment.  She said she gave the
documents she had to the Administrator.
[172]      
The Administrator states that they did not
receive the Arista Judgment from the Consumer Debtor, only the Statement of
Claim, and it was the Administrator’s understanding from the Consumer Debtor that
Judgment had not been obtained. Accordingly the Administrator reported:
[173]      
Arista never obtained leave under BIA Rule 14(1)
to  cross-examine the Consumer Debtor, and did not cross-examine the Consumer
Debtor on the evidence in the Consumer Debtor Affidavit on this crucial issue.
[174]      
The sum total of the evidence of Arista as to
the knowledge of the Consumer Debtor of the Arista Judgment:
[175]      
The Affidavit of Service at Exhibit I to the
Arista Affidavit states:
[176]      
The only thing attached at Exhibit A to the
Affidavit of Service is a letter dated March 3, 2021 that states:
[177]      
The letter says “Enclosures” but none are
attached under that exhibit to the Arista Affidavit, and the next and last page
of Exhibit I to the Arista Affidavit is the backer for the Affidavit of Service.
The Arista Judgment is not specifically mentioned in the letter. The Arista
Judgment is nowhere attached at Exhibit I to the Arista Affidavit, despite what
paragraph 9 of the Arista Affidavit states.
[178]      
The Garnishment Notice at Exhibit H to the Arista
Affidavit does attach a Garnishment Affidavit and attaches the Arista Judgment
as Exhibit A to the Garnishment Affidavit.
[179]      
So to summarize, the evidence of the Consumer
Debtor is that she did not have details of the Arista Judgment, and only found
out when her bank account was garnished.
[180]      
The Administrator reports that the Consumer
Debtor only provided the Arista Statement of Claim.
[181]      
Arista’s evidence is that they sent the Garnishment
Affidavit to the Consumer Debtor by registered mail at the Bethany Address
according to the Affidavit of Service at Exhibit I to the Arista Affidavit, and
that the Garnishment Affidavit at Exhibit H does attach the Judgment, but that
proof is not in Exhibit I, despite what is stated in the Arista Affidavit. 
Arista had the ability to clearly provide this evidence on this crucial issue in
their motion materials on this motion and has failed to do so.
[182]      
The Factum and Supplementary Factum repeat over
and over that the Consumer Debtor was aware of the Judgment and deliberately
hid the quantum to qualify for a consumer proposal, but despite having years to
prove those assertions prior to the hearing of this Motion Arista has failed to
clearly do so, and the Court is left to infer the evidence on this most crucial
issue.
[183]      
It is my supposition that the Garnishment Notice
and Garnishment Affidavit were sent to the Consumer Debtor at the  Bethany
Property by registered mail, but after that there is no direct evidence she
received it.
[184]      
It is also my supposition that the Garnishment
Notice provided the Consumer Debtor with the amount of the Arista Judgment even
if not attached, and prompted the Consumer Debtor to seek relief under the
BIA.  But my suppositions are not evidence of her actual knowledge.
[185]      
I have no reason to disbelieve the
Administrator’s Report that the Consumer Debtor provided the Statement of Claim,
but not the Garnishment Materials, and she filed a Notice of Intent to Defend,
so she was clearly aware of the Arista Action.
[186]      
However, as stated by Associate Justice Rappos
in Singh:
[187]      
The BIA imposes duties on the Consumer Debtor to
provide materials to the Administrator because the Consumer Debtor is best
source of those materials, in particular given the context of the restrictions
on fees payable to Administrators and the abbreviated time periods and approval
procedures in the Consumer Proposal provisions of the BIA that prevent
Administrators from being able to conduct extensive investigations, unlike in
Division 1 Proposals that do not have these restrictions.
[188]      
In the murky evidence of whether the Consumer
Debtor received the Arista Judgment and provided it to the Administrator, and
without cross-examination on the issue, it is difficult to determine with
certainty the actual state of knowledge of the Consumer Debtor of the Judgment,
but I do believe that the Consumer Debtor received the “Garnishment Materials”,
and whether she knew their precise legal implications or not, should have
provided them to the Administrator.
[189]      
If not Arista admittedly receiving the Creditors
Package, in sufficient time to prove its claim and request a meeting, making
the Consumer Debtor’s lack of compliance less relevant than in the ordinary
“did not declare” case, then this conduct by the Consumer Debtor would ordinarily
weigh IN FAVOUR of annulling the Consumer Proposal.
[190]      
As I have written in some detail, Arista was on
November 17, 2021 admittedly in full knowledge of the Consumer Proposal,  and
the contents of the documents in the Creditors Package, include the numerous
notices in the Creditors Package that participation in the Consumer Proposal
Proceedings was conditional upon Arista Proving its claim, which I have
detailed in these reasons.
[191]      
On that date the Administrator additionally told
counsel for Arista:
[192]      
On November 17, 2021 Arista still had 37 days to
file a proof of claim to prove the Arista Claim under the Arista Judgment, which
would give Arista the standing to request a meeting of creditors in writing
after it did so.
[193]      
Inexplicably Arista did not do so, and all of
the events and proceedings taken by Arista subsequently, including this
Annulment Motion, the Newmarket Application and the Arista Administrator Action
are a consequence of that failure by Arista.
[194]      
That is all they needed to do.  They didn’t do
it.  Here we are.
[195]      
Many arguments were made by Arista that the
Consumer Proposal was a nullity merely because they on November 17, 2021
alleged they had a judgment that pushed the amounts owing by the Consumer
Debtor beyond the $250,000.  That is simply wrong in law given the wording of s.66.13(4)
which states:
[196]      
Arista also argued that the Administrator should
have adjourned the “meeting” for further investigation, after having the Arista
Judgment (but not a proof of claim that it was mandatory that Arista properly file)
emailed to it by Arista, when neither the Administrator, nor for that matter
the Court, has the jurisdiction to postpone the time periods for deemed
acceptance of a Consumer Proposal.
[197]      
As stated in Re Sutherland (1995), 1995 CanLII 9206 (AB KB), 34
Alta. L.R. (3d) 356, [1996] 2 W.W.R. 379, 36 C.B.R. (3d) 208, 1995 CarswellAlta
732 (Q.B.):
[198]      
There is also no jurisdiction in the BIA for the
Administrator to “Revoke” the Consumer Proposal once Arista did file the Arista
Proof of Claim in January of 2022, after it was statutorily deemed accepted, as
was also demanded of the Administrator by Arista.
[199]      
In this case, as counsel for Arista were dealing
with this matter, rather than non-legally trained persons, the doctrine in Port

436, 193 B.C.A.C. 114, 23 B.C.L.R. (4th) 335, 316 W.A.C. 114, 49 C.B.R. (4th)
146 may also be applicable in the Court’s analysis, as given the sophistication
of Arista and its counsel, the expectation would be that they would be held to
a higher standard of adhering to the formal requirements of filing a proof of
claim under the BIA than an ordinary creditor proceeding without legal representation:
[200]      
The best “investigation” that could possibly
have occurred in this case would have been if Arista had filed its proof of
claim in a timely manner.
[201]      
Arista also argued that the court approval of
the Consumer Proposal was obtained by fraud due to the non-disclosure of the
Arista Judgment by the Consumer Debtor.  It was not.  Court approval was
obtained due to the failure of Arista to file a proof of claim within the time
periods prescribed in the BIA and requesting a meeting.
[202]      
Arista cites Automotive Finance v Davies
2002 BCSC 509 at paragraphs 33-34 (“Automotive Finance”) as
supporting their case.  But in that case, like Singh is a “did not
disclose” case where the creditor did not know about the consumer proposal, at
all.
[203]      
This case is much more factually similar to the
unreported case Re Chao (31-2644762) cited by Arista that was decided by
my colleague Registrar Jean on February 3, 2022 (“Chao”).  In
that case:
[204]      
In this case the Consumer Debtor, also stated
she provided “all of the documents” to the Administrator.  Registrar Jean
stated on that issue in Chao:
[205]      
With respect to the issue of error of counsel
Registrar Jean states:
[206]      
The litany of itemized errors of omission and
commission made by Arista in this case is far greater than the missing of a
box-tick in a voting letter to request a meeting for a properly proven claim,
within the statutory time periods, like in Chao.
[207]      
Another similar case where the issue was the
solvency of the consumer debtor not the debt limit, Proposition de Pilon,
2021 CarswellQue 18300, 94 C.B.R. (6th) 220, 2021 QCCS 4632 (C.S. Que.), (“Pilon”)
the decision of Belanger, J.C.S. was summarized as follows in Houlden &
Morawetz: § 4:164. Annulment of a Consumer Proposal:
[208]      
In particular Belanger, J.C.S. states:
[209]      
In this case this Singh factor weighs in
favour of NOT annulling the consumer proposal.
[210]      
Whatever the lack of clarity as to what the
Consumer Debtor knew of the Arista Judgment, when she knew it, and how the
Consumer Proposal was formulated and implemented, and why Arista did not file
the Arista Proof of Claim in a timely manner, it is absolutely clear that with the
admission of the Arista Proof of Claim of $451,710.12, additional to the $19,401
declared on the Statement of Affairs by the Consumer Debtor, the “aggregate
debts” of the Consumer Debtor exceeded the $250,000 permitted in the definition
of “consumer debtor” in s.66.11:
[211]      
Unlike Chao, although there may be some unresolved-to-date
set offs, the Arista Proof of Claim as admitted is based on the Arista
Judgment, and therefore a liquidated amount.  As of the date of the Consumer
Proposal the Arista Claim under the Arista Judgment was $451,710.12.
[212]      
As a result I must conclude that on the date of
the Consumer Proposal the Consumer Debtor was not a “Consumer Debtor” eligible
to make the Consumer Proposal.
[213]      
As stated by Registrar Jean in Bouillion, Re,
2001 CanLII 28450 (ON SC):
[214]      
The provisions of the BIA s.66.3, and the
jurisprudence, specifically allows the Court to exercise its discretion to not
annul a Consumer Proposal despite a finding that the debtor had been found not
to fit the definition of a “consumer debtor” as per the Schryburt (Re),
2011 ONSC 880 (CanLII) case cited by the Consumer Debtor (“Schryburt”):
[215]      
In Jalal, cited by the Consumer Debtor, (as
well as in Schryburt),  Registrar Nettie makes the distinction between
cases like Boullion where at the time of the filing of the Consumer
Proposal the debtor was not eligible to make it, to the “subsequent discovery” of
a claim cases where the claim was not in existence at the time of the making of
the consumer proposal, but came into existence or became liquidated after the
approval of the Consumer Proposal.
[216]      
That discretion must be exercised judicially, as
stated by Kershman, J. in O’Leary:
[217]      
In this case the issue is both. The Consumer
Debtor was not eligible as of the date of filing because the Arista Judgment
was already a liquidated claim in excess of $250,000, but this Consumer
Proposal only got this far due to the errors of Arista and its counsel in
failing to prove its claim in a timely fashion. Had they done so earlier,
notwithstanding any conduct of the Consumer Debtor, the ineligibility would
have been confirmed in November of 2021, not January of 2022 after deemed
approval.
[218]      
This Singh factor clearly weighs IN
FAVOUR OF annulling the consumer proposal.
[219]      
Similar to Chao, in this case Arista is
by far the largest creditor in the estate, with the largest (now) proven claim,
and the claim is liquidated by the Arista Judgment that was not stayed or
appealed prior to the filing of the Consumer Proposal.
[220]      
There is only one other creditor Melvin
Mariathas with a proven claim of $1,000.  This is very similar to the bankruptcy
discharge context of cases like Kozack v. Richter (1973), 1973 CanLII 166 (SCC), [1974] S.C.R.
832, 20 C.B.R. (N.S.) 223, [1973] 5 W.W.R. 470, 36 D.L.R. (3d) 612 where the
Court gives guidance regarding the granting of a discharge order with a higher
conditional payment to deal with bankruptcies involving one large judgment
debt:
[221]      
In effect this Consumer Proposal was made to one
creditor, Arista, which would have had a $451,710.12 claim to vote against, but
for Arista’s failure to prove their claim in a timely fashion.  As a result,
the Consumer Proposal actually approved by the vote of the then sole proven
creditor voting, Melvin Mariathas,  with a $1,000.00 claim.
[222]      
As stated in Chao, cited by Arista:
[223]      
The source of the debt was as alleged and deemed
found by the default judgment, the failure of the Consumer Debtor and
Manoranjan to complete a real estate purchase transaction.  As such this debt
does not have the intrinsic characteristics of fraud or other malfeasance.  It
is an ordinary breach of contract/failure to complete claim.
[224]      
Given that yawning chasm between the $1000.00
Mariathas claim that approved the Consumer Proposal, and the $451,710.12 Arista
Claim that didn’t, as well as the quantum and the exclusiveness of the Arista
Claim, this Singh factor clearly weighs IN FAVOUR OF annulling the
consumer proposal.
[225]      
No serious time was spent by counsel for the
Consumer Debtor arguing that Arista was dilatory in first bringing the
annulment Motion.  On September 13, 2022, according to emails at Exhibit K to
the Report, Arista first expressed the intention to the Administrator to bring
the annulment motion  and the email from Judd to Campbell states “We have
received your Notice of Motion and assertions made therein”.
[226]      
Apparently a Motion Record was served in May 31,
2023.  It appears that the Notice of Motion dated May 31, 2023 that was heard
by me, materially differs in the relief sought from the Notice of Motion served
by Counsel for Arista in September 2022  which was dated July 28, 2022 (at
Exhibit K to the Report) and which has the following additional relief requested:
[227]      
This request for leave went strangely missing
from the relief sought in the Notice of Motion for the Motion that I actually heard,
with no blacklining or strikeouts to warn the Court something had been removed,
which suggests that Arista was not ignorant of the requirement to request leave
under the provisions of the BIA as at July 2022, but made the conscious choice
not to proceed to obtain leave prior to commencing the Newmarket Application in
October 3, 2022.
[228]      
As this was not argued, this Singh factor
does not favour either the Consumer Debtor or Arista.
[229]      
As now Arista is (in practical terms) the only material
Proven Creditor given the size of its claim, the estimated realization under
the Consumer Proposal for Arista is currently in the range of 3.66% down from
the original 87.82% in the Consumer Proposal, without the proven Arista Claim.
[230]      
Whatever the behaviour of the Consumer Debtor
and Arista, the inherent bargain implicit in the Consumer Proposal that was
deemed approved, and the current results, are so vastly different, as to
constitute a giant windfall for the Consumer Debtor, intentional or not,
assisted in that windfall by the errors of Arista.
[231]      
The outcomes of the Consumer Proposal process
should not depend on good or bad luck, or be dependant on the happenstance of
the largest creditor being seemingly unable to follow simple, repeated, written
instructions.  This situation is so extreme as to constitute an injustice to
Arista, despite Arista’s substantial contribution to the creation of its own injustice.
[232]      
The Consumer Debtor has been paying under the
terms of the Consumer Proposal since January of 2022, but Associate Justice
Rappos annulled a fully performed consumer proposal in Singh, where Singh
was found not eligible to make one, where the margin was vastly smaller than
the at least $210,000 difference between the proven debts and the $250,000 Consumer
Debtor threshold in this case.
[233]      
This Singh factor clearly weighs IN
FAVOUR OF annulling the consumer proposal.
[234]      
The larger issue in this Motion is that the
Consumer Proposal process is dependant on Consumer Debtors providing proper
information to the Administrator in formulating the consumer proposal, and
determining whether the debtor fits within the definition of a “consumer
debtor”.
[235]      
As the jurisprudence sets out, the intent is to create
a more efficient, expeditious procedure that reduces procedural costs and
professional fees to maximize recoveries to creditors where the debts are below
$250,000.  The procedure does so by eliminating much of the oversight by the
creditors and the Court.
[236]      
The Court system simply could not provide
judicial oversight for an additional 98,000 Division 1 Proposal proceedings
annually, each requiring the full panoply of steps and motions that need to be
taken and heard to approve and implement a Division 1 Proposal.
[237]      
In addition, for most consumer proposal estates,
the additional professional and time cost to creditors of this additional oversight
would result in a paradoxical Jarndyce v. Jarndyce situation where only
the professionals would benefit in these smaller estates.
[238]      
The institution by Parliament of the $250,000
limit as the bright line between those claims that should have the full
procedural protections of a Division 1 Proposal, and those that will not, makes
the determination of “Consumer Debtor” eligibility crucial to prevent
situations such as this one, where practically the sole creditor, with a
judgment that is on its own is greater than the $250,000 limit, could be forced
to accept a compromise of its claim that it could not vote on due to its own errors,
where when the Consumer Debtor was not eligible to make the Consumer Proposal
in the first place.
[239]      
This gatekeeping function of the $250,000 limit
must be very carefully enforced to avoid encouraging debtors to understate
their debts in order to get in under the Consumer Debtor $250,000 limit, necessitating
motions such as this.
[240]      
Failure to do so which create the opposite of
the cost efficient, expeditious proceeding for dealing with consumer debt, that
maximizes recoveries to creditors, and would encourage debtors to understate
their debts to qualify for a Consumer Proposal, and the lack of oversight.
[241]      
In these circumstances, the perception of the
integrity of the bankruptcy system, in the context of the conduct of this
Consumer Debtor, clearly weighs IN FAVOUR OF annulling the Consumer Proposal.
[242]      
Other than Singh, most of the
jurisprudence cited herein predates the amendment of the BIA in 2019 to codify
the Duty of Good Faith as a cornerstone principle underlying the BIA.
[243]      
The Consumer Debtor cited section 4.2 in its
argument, arguing that the Consumer Debtor showed good faith.
