On March 14,
2023, I dismissed the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their Statement of Claim to
add Dr. Sharon Koren as a defendant pursuant to Rules 5.04 (2) and 26.01. I
provide herein my reasons.
[2]              
This is a medical
malpractice action. The plaintiffs allege
that Kelly Morgan-Batten’s death was caused by the negligent care and treatment provided
by the defendants.
[3]              
On February 16,
2018, Ms. Morgan-Batten asked her family doctor, Dr. Obomighie, to refer her to
Dr. Koren, a rheumatologist.
[4]              
On February 25, 2018, Dr.
Obomighie faxed to Dr. Koren’s office a consultation request, a copy of Ms.
Morgan-Batten’s recent bloodwork and a letter from Ms. Morgan-Batten listing
her various symptoms. The consultation request stated that the reason for the
consultation was “concerns about Sjogrens syndrome.”
[5]              
On May 23, 2018, Ms. Morgan-Batten
saw Dr. Koren. Dr. Koren dictated a consult note immediately after seeing Ms.
Morgan-Batten. However, Dr. Koren pasted a consult note for another patient
into the software she uses and sent that erroneous consult note to Dr.
Obomighie on May 23, 2018. The erroneous consult note included Ms.
Morgan-Batten’s
[6]              
On August 30, 2021,
the Statement of Claim was issued.
[7]              
Ms. Morgan-Batten died on November 28, 2020.
[8]              
On November 16, 2022, the plaintiffs’ counsel wrote to Dr. Koren requesting her records.
The same day Dr. Koren discovered that she had sent the erroneous consult note
to Dr. Obomighie and the same day informed the plaintiffs of her error. The plaintiffs received a copy of Dr.
Koren’s correct consult note on November 16, 2022.
[9]              
Section 38(3)
of the Trustee Act states that an action
brought on behalf
of a deceased person
“shall not be brought after the expiration of two years from the death of the
deceased.”
[10]          
The discoverability principle does not apply
to s. 38(3) (Waschkowski v. Hopkinson Estate, 2000 CanLII 5646 (ON CA), at para. 16) and s. 38(3) does not extend the limitation period that would otherwise
apply had the deceased not died (Camarata v. Morgan, 2009 ONCA
38, at para. 8).
[11]          
The application of s. 38(1) is not
restricted to torts alone. The determination of whether a claim falls within
the scope of s. 38(1) focuses on the nature of the injury not the form of the action,
in tort or contract or otherwise (Bonaparte v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 40016 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No 1046 (ON CA), at para 54).
[12]          
In rare circumstances a party may be added
after the two-year
limitation found in s. 38(3). There are two common
law exceptions: fraudulent concealment and special
circumstances.
[13]          
Only in their
reply factum did the plaintiffs raise fraudulent concealment and special
circumstances, relying on the fact that Dr. Koren sent the erroneous consult
letter. However, neither apply in this case.
[14]          
Fraudulent concealment requires
that the defendant “hide, secret, cloak, camouflage, disguise, cover-up the
conduct or identity of the wrongdoing” (Zeppa v. Woodbridge Heating &
Air-Conditioning Ltd., 2019 ONCA 47). There is no such evidence here. Dr.
Koren made an error in good faith and corrected it immediately when she discovered
her error.
[15]          
The doctrine
of special circumstances was considered by this court in Omerod
v. Strathroy Middlesex General
Hospital 2013 ONSC 992. I have considered the general principles summarized
at paragraph 41 of that case.
[16]            
In this case I note the following:
[17]          
There are no special
circumstances in this case.
[18]          
I
am also concerned with the evidence
adduced by the plaintiffs in support of this motion. Mr. Syrtash provided an affidavit
as a person associated with the plaintiffs’ lawyers. His evidence describes
what his firm did, putting at issue the litigation decisions made by the
plaintiffs’ lawyers. By relying on evidence of their lawyers’
decision not to name Dr. Koren
in their claim, the plaintiffs have waived privilege
over their entire solicitor’s file (Lawless
[19]          
Dr. Koren is entitled
to her costs. I have encouraged the parties to discuss and agree on an
amount that the successful party would be entitled to. If the parties cannot
agree on costs, I will receive
submissions from Dr. Koren within two weeks and the plaintiffs within three
weeks (maximum of three pages).
