The applicant mother, MD, and the respondent
father, NP, were a common law couple, starting in @2013.  There is one child of
the relationship, C, born in 2014.The parties separated in 2015.

This proceeding was started by application dated
September 18, 2015.

The parties settled many issues prior to trial.
They are to be congratulated for this, particularly given the protracted and
hard-fought litigation (nine years and dozens of court endorsements).

Parenting time is now 60/40 between the applicant
and the respondent, with the Respondent spending 6 of 14 overnights with C.

The focus of this trial was child support,
section 7 expenses, and therapy. As an overview, I have imputed income to MD in
the amount OF $72,072 and made corresponding findings on child support and
section 7 expenses. With respect to therapy, the parties are required to engage
in family therapy to improve the parties’ co-parenting skills and provide C
with needed supports.

A great deal of trial time was spent on the past. While
the court is always appreciative of context, the focus on past events was not
always relevant or productive.  It is time for the parties to focus on a path
forward for the sake of C.

At the outset of trial, the parties requested a consent order to
anonymize the parties.  During the trial, I agreed that this is an appropriate
order to make in light of the publication ban made in another proceeding
involving these parties. In addition, the trial evidence required the court to
consider some personal health information of the parties and the child.
[8]         
The parties did not request a sealing order, nor would this have been
granted.  However, I am satisfied that granting an order to anonymize the
parties and the child of the marriage is appropriate in the circumstances of
this case.

At the outset of trial, the parties advised the court that “90%” of the
issues had resolved.  These included:
