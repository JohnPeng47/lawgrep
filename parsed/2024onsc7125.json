    "summary": "Mr. Birtch was granted a mistrial on two counts of a previous guilty verdict due to inadequate Crown disclosure efforts, which breached his s. 7 Charter rights. The trial judge decided that meaningful redress required a mistrial, given that the non-disclosure interfered with the ability to make full answer and defence. Further submissions are invited regarding the possible application of the mistrial ruling to Count 3."
