This motion was referred to me by the
registrar’s office under rule 2.1.01(7) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
RRO 1990, Reg. 194, after receipt of a request by defendant’s counsel under
rule 2.1.01(6) to have the action dismissed for not pleading a cause of action and
appearing on its face to be frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of process of the
court.
[2]              
On October 1, 2024, I noted that the action may
be frivolous, vexatious, or abusive and called on the plaintiff to provide written
submissions as to why the claim should not be dismissed.  The allotted time for
submissions has passed without the plaintiff making any.
[3]              
As explained below, I am satisfied that the
action is frivolous and should be dismissed without costs.
[4]              
Under rule 2.1.01, the court may stay or dismiss
a proceeding that appears on its face to be frivolous, vexatious, or otherwise
an abuse of the process of the court. Rule 2.1 is interpreted and applied
robustly so a motion judge may effectively exercise their gatekeeping function
to dismiss litigation that is clearly frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of
process. The use of rule 2.1 is limited to the clearest of cases where the
abusive nature of the proceeding is apparent on the face of the pleading and
there is a basis for resorting to this attenuated process: Scaduto v. The
Law Society of Upper Canada, 2015 ONCA 733 at para 8, leave to appeal
refused 2016 CanLII 27190 (SCC); Sumner v.
Ottawa (Police Services), 2023 ONCA 140
at para 9; Wu v. Toronto (City), 2024 ONCA 810 at para 3.
[5]              
A frivolous proceeding lacks
a legal basis, or legal merit, or is brought without reasonable grounds and is readily
recognized as devoid of merit with little prospect of success: Rahman v. Financial Services Regulatory
Authority of Ontario, 2025
ONSC 1210 at para 6; Van
Sluytman v. Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital, 2017 ONSC 692 at para 11; Gill v. MacIver, 2023 ONCA 776 at para 3; Lavallee v. Isak, 2022 ONCA 290 at para 19; Pickard v. London Police Services Board, 2010
ONCA 643 at para 19. A frivolous action
is one that will necessarily or inevitably fail: Rahman at para 6.
[6]              
A motion under rule 2.1 focuses on the pleadings
and any submissions made by the parties under the rule.  No evidence is
submitted on a rule 2.1 motion: Scaduto at paras 9 and 11-12.
[7]              
The court should not use
rule 2.1.01 for close calls. However, neither the opposing parties nor the
court should be required to devote scarce resources to proceedings that are
clearly frivolous. Allowing a clearly frivolous proceeding to remain on the
court docket is not beneficial and takes time away from other more meritorious
cases: Rahman at para 7.
[8]              
Having read the statement of claim in the
broadest and least-critical manner, with generous allowances for drafting
deficiencies, I find that the claim is clearly frivolous and will inevitably
fail for lacking reasonable grounds: Sumner at para 9. The claim does
not assert a cause of action and pleads no material facts to support a claim
for damages or other relief against the defendant. The claim refers to an incident
at the Brampton Courthouse on April 23, 2024 when the plaintiff suffered a
heart attack, indicates that the plaintiff is separated from children, and refers
to “corrupt Canadian police constables” but without articulating a legally
recognizable or perceptible claim against the defendant. Regrettably, the plaintiff
seems to be dealing with health issues and other hardship. That said, it is
clear that the statement of claim does not establish a viable or meritorious claim
against the defendant.
[9]              
Taking this all into account, I find that the
statement of claim is clearly frivolous for having no legal basis, merit or
reasonable grounds and, therefore, no chance of success.  The plaintiff did not
make any submissions to suggest otherwise.
[10]          
Accordingly, the action is dismissed under rule
2.1.01 without costs.
