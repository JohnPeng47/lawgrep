[1]              
The Appellant, Mr. Octavio Gomez, appeals from his
conviction for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 320.14(a)
of the Criminal Code (“Code”),[1] and operation of a motor
vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of greater than 80 mg per 100 ml of
blood, contrary to s. 320.14(b) of the Code.
[2]              
On December 18, 2022,
Cst. Jaggon of the Ottawa Police Service was on general patrol in a marked
police cruiser.
[3]              
At 5:09 am, Mr. Gomez
pulled out from a side street in front of Cst. Jaggon’s cruiser without
yielding to his right of way and narrowly avoiding an accident.  He was driving
without his rear lights on.
[4]              
Cst. Jaggon initiated a traffic
stop.  The Appellant pulled over but mounted the curb.
[5]              
Cst. Jaggon spoke to Mr.
Gomez and asked him whether he was aware he had parked his car partially on the
sidewalk.  The Appellant indicated he did not realize he had done that.  Cst.
Jaggon also informed the Appellant that he was driving with his lights off.
[6]              
TMr. Gomez was asked
for his driver’s licence and other documentation.  He provided his health card
to the officer.
[7]              
Cst. Jaggon noticed an
open bottle of liquor in the central console with a shot glass on top.  The
bottle was within easy reach of the Appellant.  He asked the Appellant
whether he had been drinking and the Appellant responded that he may have had
two shots.
[8]              
Consequently, the
officer asked tMr. Gomez to get out of his car and walk to the rear of the
car.  The Appellant had difficulty doing so and had to lean on the car to
steady himself as he was walking.  The officer formed the opinion that the
Appellant was impaired by alcohol and arrested him, read him his rights to
counsel, and made a breathalyser demand.
[9]              
There are no issues in
relation to the events that took place after the arrest and before the intoxilyzer
results
were obtained.  Two tests were taken, and the results were 198 mg per 100 ml of
blood and 202 mg per 100 ml of blood, respectively.
[10]          
The Appellant was
released at 12:20 pm the same day.
[11]          
Two issues were raised at trial and
are being raised again on this appeal.
[12]          
First, whether the Appellant’s s.
10(a) right pursuant to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“Charter”),[2]
was breached because Cst. Jaggon failed to inform him why he was being asked to
exit his vehicle.
[13]          
Second, whether the
Appellant’s s. 9 right pursuant to the Charter was breached because of
the delay in releasing him from custody.
[14]          
As noted earlier, the Appellant raised
the same Charter issues at trial as are being raised on appeal.
[15]          
There were only two witnesses at trial
– Cst. Jaggon and Sgt. Balasundaram.  The trial judge found both witnesses to
be credible and reliable.[3]
[16]          
The primary witness in
relation to the purported s. 10(a) Charter breach was Cst. Jaggon.  At
trial, Defence counsel argued that Cst. Jaggon failed to tell Mr. Gomez of the
reason for the stop and failed to tell the Appellant the reason for the demand
to exit his vehicle.  The Trial Judge found that Cst. Jaggon had informed the
Appellant of the reason for the stop. Defence counsel is not taking issue with
that aspect of the trial judge’s ruling.[4]
[17]          
With respect to the
issue of whether the Appellant understood why he was pulled over, the Trial Judge
found that Cst. Jaggon told Mr. Gomez that he did not have his rear lights on. 
The Appellant responded that he was unaware of that fact.  The Trial Judge
found that this response was a clear indication that the Appellant had been
made aware of the reason that he had been pulled over.[5]
[18]          
The Trial Judge agreed
with Defence’s assertion that the Appellant’s jeopardy had changed when he was
asked to get out of his car.  When Cst. Jaggon made that demand, he had noticed
the presence of a bottle of vodka in the center console of the car within easy
reach of the Appellant.  Cst. Jaggon asked Mr. Gomez if had been drinking and
the Appellant responded “maybe two shots”.[6]
[19]          
In relation to whether
the Appellant understood from the circumstances that the focus of his interaction with
the police officer had changed, the Trial Judge stated,
[20]          
Defence counsel also
asserted at trial that Mr. Gomez’s s. 9 Charter right to be free from
arbitrary detention had been breached when he spent three and a half hours in
custody after he had been served with all the documents necessary to be
released.
[21]          
At trial and on this appeal, counsel for the Appellant argued in their
written materials that the time period of the alleged overholding should start
as of the end of the taking of the second intoxilyzer test at 7:31am.  In oral
argument, both counsel focused on the time period starting with the service of
the final document by Cst. Jaggon at 8:56am and ending with Mr. Gomez’ release
at 12:20pm.
[22]          
In my view, this narrowing of the timeframe was wise.  Between the end
of the second intoxilyzer test and the service of the final document, Cst.
Jaggon testified that he was carefully preparing all the relevant documentation. 
This matter was his first impaired driving case that he had handled alone, and
he indicated that he was being particularly careful to ensure that he got it
all correct.  That process took time. In the circumstances, a finding that this
time did not qualify as an arbitrary detention was inevitable.
[23]          
The sergeant in charge
of the cellblock on December 18, 2022, testified at trial.  Sgt.
Balasundaram stated that he was the only sergeant who was on duty, and he
oversaw all the intake as well as the security and well-being of all the
inmates (who could number as many as 65).[8]
[24]          
Sgt. Balasundaram
testified that when deciding when to release someone from the cellblock, he
took into consideration a variety of factors. Some of the factors relate to the
cellblock as a whole and some to the individual detainee.
[25]          
The sergeant stated
that factors relating to the cellblock included how busy it was, managing
detainees making lawyers’ calls, maintaining the privacy of the individual detainees,
and whether there were any medical emergencies.[9]
[26]          
He added that factors
relating to the specific inmate included such issues as whether the detainee:
[27]          
Sgt. Balasundaram was
unable to recall very much detail in relation to Mr. Gomez.  He
recalled Mr. Gomez’ arrival and had made a note of the fact that he was
slightly unsteady on his feet.[15]
He was aware that the Appellant had intoxilyzer readings of approximately 200 mg
per 100 ml of blood. In preparation for trial, Sgt. Balasundaram had reviewed
the cellblock logs and was aware that regular checks had been made on the
Appellant while he was in the cellblock.[16] 
When shown the cellblock log, he was able to confirm that the Appellant had
been released at 12:20pm.[17]
[28]          
The Trial Judge
reviewed the caselaw on this issue and determined that there are competing
decisions on the issue of the amount of time a person can be detained on the
sole basis of blood alcohol readings.[18]
[29]          
Ultimately, he
concluded,
[30]          
The Trial Judge
concluded that there had been no breach of either s. 10(a) or s. 9 of the Charter
and convicted Mr. Gomez on both counts.
[31]          
The standard for
appellate review is set out in R. v. Biniaris.[20] The Supreme Court of Canada cites the
traditional test of whether a properly instructed jury, acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered the impugned verdict, and then goes on to comment:
[32]          
In Biniaris, the
Court also indicated that in reviewing a trial judge’s reasons for judgment, an
appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the evaluation of the evidence,
or in the analysis.  If so, then the appellate court could reverse the trial
judge’s decision.  However, trial judges are entitled to be accorded deference
with respect to their findings of fact, particularly where findings of
credibility are made.  As noted in Biniaris,
[33]          
As other courts have
noted, a verdict is unreasonable if the trier of fact made a “palpable and
overriding error” and its functional equivalents, including “clearly wrong”,
and “not reasonably supported by the evidence”.[23]
[34]          
Counsel in the present
matter are in agreement that the issues raised concern mixed fact and law and
therefore, the test is whether the trial judge made a palpable and overriding
error.
[35]          
Pursuant to s. 10(a) of
the Charter, everyone has the right on detention to be informed promptly
of the reasons thereof.  Accordingly, a person does not have to
submit to a detention without knowing the reasons for that detention.
[36]          
The term “promptly” has
been interpreted to mean “immediately”.[24]
[37]          
The Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Evans noted that,
[38]          
That decision is
eminently practical given the fluid and sometimes volatile
situation of a roadside stop.
[39]          
Interestingly, despite
the statement by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Evans
case, the issue of what is needed to fulfill the informational component of the
s. 10 Charter right has been subsequently the subject of considerable
debate in the caselaw.
[40]          
There is a line of
cases, primarily summary conviction appellate cases, that
is divided over what precisely is required to comply with s. 10(a).
[41]          
Starting with R. v.
Evans (a different Evans than the Supreme Court of Canada case),
there is a line of cases that insists that the informational component of s. 10
can only be met if the detaining officer explicitly states the reason for the
detention.[26]
[42]          
On the other hand,
there is another line of cases that is more concerned with
substance than with form.
[43]          
In R. v. Mann,
the Supreme Court of Canada summarized the requirement that was to be met in s.
10(a) as follows, “at a minimum, individuals who are detained for
investigative purposes must…be advised, in clear and simple language, of the
reasons for the detention”.[27]
[44]          
However, as noted in R.
v. Gardner,
[45]          
In R. v. Borer,
the summary conviction appellate court upheld the trial judge’s finding that it
was evident to the accused that although she had initially been pulled over for
a traffic violation, that because of a conversation with the detaining officer,
she was subsequently being investigated for a possible impaired driving
situation.  In that case the trial judge noted,
[46]          
In R. v. Kumarasamy,
the summary conviction appellate court also upheld the
trial judge’s finding that there had not been a breach of s. 10(a).  The court
stated,
[47]          
In the present case,
the Appellant was advised by Cst. Jaggon that he had
been driving without his rear lights turned on.  There was alcohol in plain
view within easy reach of the Appellant while he was driving.  Cst. Jaggon askedMr.
Gomez how much he had had to drink, and the Appellant had responded that he had
had maybe two shots.  At that point, Cst. Jaggon
asked the Appellant to exit his car and walk towards the cruiser. The evidence
amply supported the trial judge’s conclusion that the Appellant knew the reason
for his detention.
[48]          
This ground of appeal
must fail.
[49]          
Section 9 of the Charter
states, “everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned”.
[50]          
In the context of a
detainee at a police station, s. 498 of the Code also plays a role and
it is trite law that keeping a person in custody contrary to s. 498 constitutes
arbitrary detention.[31] 
However, in the present case, Defence counsel did not suggest there had been
any contravention of the requirements of s. 498.
[51]          
Instead, the key issue argued by Defence counsel in the present case was what to
make of Sgt. Balasundaram’s evidence.
[52]          
Defence counsel argued
that in the absence of evidence that Sgt. Balasundaram adverted specifically to
Mr. Gomez’ situation, that the Trial Judge could not take into consideration
what Sgt. Balasundaram usually did to conclude that the detention was
not arbitrary.  Instead, she asserted that in the absence of anything more than
the brief notation that the Appellant was slightly unsteady on his feet when he
arrived at the station, there was a dearth of evidence concerning why he was
kept in custody for three and a half hours.  In Defence counsel’s view, given
the absence of evidence, the trial judge ought to have concluded that the
detention was arbitrary.
[53]          
Respectfully, I
disagree.
[54]          
It is not reasonable to
expect a witness to recall a routine event that occurred two years earlier. 
Nor is it reasonable to expect the sergeant in charge of a busy
cellblock with up to 65 prisoners, all of whom are being brought into custody, booked,
allowed to speak to counsel, and generally moving around the cellblockand
ultimately released, to have detailed notes of every detainee.
[55]          
In the present case, I agree with the trial judge that it would have been
nice to have a bit more in the way of information.
[56]          
However, evidence of Sgt. Balasundaram’s routine is evidence that the
trial judge was entitled to consider.
[57]          
In R. v.
Thompson,[32] the Court of Appeal for Ontario, found
that the standard practice of a police officer is evidence that a trial court
may find a verdict upon.  Of note, is that Thompson dealt with the
administration of a roadside breath sample.  At issue was if, “the trial
judge erred in finding that [the officer] had checked for obstructions in the
mouthpiece before the appellant's apparent attempts to blow into it. Her
evidence was that, although she had no specific memory of doing so, she did
check for obstructions because this was her standard practice”.[33]
 The Court found that the officer’s evidence of her routine practice could
be used to determine what had happened on the date in question.
[58]          
Moreover, in
Sopinka’s The Law of Evidence in Canada[34] the authors state:
[59]          
Specifically,
in R. v. Watson, Doherty J.A. defines
habit as:
[60]          
Doherty
J.A., in Watson, concludes upon reviewing various authorities on evidence that:
[61]          
Later,
Doherty J.A., referring to McCormick on Evidence (4th ed.), writes in Watson:
[62]          
Notably,
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Ashmore, states:
[63]          
The Court
of Appeal for Ontario, in R. v. Vant affirms the importance of evidence
of habit, finding “the potential for prejudice is substantially lessened in cases of habit since the detailed patterns of
situation-specific behaviour that constitute habits seem unlikely to provoke
much sympathy or antipathy in the trier of fact”.[39]
[64]          
Still, the
Court of Appeal for Ontario offers important
limits to the use of habit evidence. Notably the Court limits it application in
aiding the credibility of a witness:
[65]          
In the present case,
Sgt. Balasundaram testified to his habit and all the various
factors that he took into consideration before releasing a detainee.  He was a
10-year veteran of the police service and on a 2-year rotation as a cellblock
supervisor.[41] 
The trial judge found as a fact that the sergeant was “one who makes decisions
in a careful and measured fashion”.[42]
[66]          
It was open to the Trial
Judge to find that Sgt. Balasundaram was an officer who routinely made careful
decisions and who relied on the factors that he outlined in his
evidence to make those decisions and that, therefore, the sergeant had followed
his normal practice on the date in question when deciding when to release Mr.
Gomez.
[67]          
In addition, there is appellate caselaw that strongly suggests that high blood
alcohol readings, of themselves, are enough to justify keeping a detainee in
custody.
[68]          
The Trial JJudge chose
not to follow the Court of Appeal decision of R. v. Sapusak.[43] 
He accepted Defence counsel’s argument that it was an endorsement only and
should be treated with caution.  That decision states,
[69]          
However, I agree with
Heeney J. in Kavanagh that this decision is “clear and binding authority
for the proposition that detaining an individual for his own protection for 6
to 7 hours based solely on readings of 130 mg per 100 ml of blood does not
constitute arbitrary detention”.[45]
[70]          
Consequently, there is
no palpable and overriding error and this ground of
appeal fails.
[71]          
Defence counsel asked
the court to opine on the issue of the exclusion of
the evidence, regardless of whether it found a breach of a Charter right
to have occurred.
[72]          
Defence counsel also conceded that a breach of s. 10(a), by itself, would not meet
the criteria in s. 24(2).  She argued that it would be the cumulative effect of
the two breaches, or alternatively, the effect of the s. 9 Charter
breach on its own that would justify the exclusion of the evidence.
[73]          
For the following
reasons, I find that even if the court found that there was a breach of both s.
10(a) and s. 9 or, alternatively, solely a breach of s. 9, the evidence should
not be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
[74]          
Section 24(2) of the Charter
engages the potential exclusion of evidence that is ‘obtained in a manner’ that
infringes a right.  In determining whether evidence has been obtained in that
manner, causal, temporal and contextual factors are all relevant.[46]
In the context of an overholding, contextual factors are paramount as
generally, the court is required to reach backwards to exclude evidence that
was obtained prior to the breach.
[75]          
As noted in R. v.
Plaha,
[76]          
If, in the present
case, the court had found solely a breach of s. 9, in my view the intoxilyzer
results would not have been excluded because there is no connexion
between the intoxilyzer results and the overholding.  Cst. Jaggon stopped Mr.
Gomez, formed the requisite grounds, made a proper demand and took Mr. Gomez
into custody for a breath test.  The breath tests and analysis were performed
by an intoxilyzer technician and there was no breach of any Charter
right. The Appellant was then returned to the cellblock and Sgt. Balasundaram
kept the Appellant in custody until his release.
[77]          
If a s. 9 breach
occurred, it would have been committed by Sgt. Balasundaram, who had nothing to
do with any of the previous, lawful events.  In my view, it
was a separate transaction.
[78]          
As stated in Kavanagh,
[79]          
Only if the court found that both s. 10(a) and s. 9 had been breached,
would it be possible to find that the evidence had been obtained in a manner
that infringed Charter rights.
[80]          
The cumulative effect
of the two breaches would then need to be analyzed pursuant to the three
factors outlined in R. v. Grant:
[81]          
In the present case, if
there was a breach of s. 10(a) it would be at the very low end of the spectrum,
given the Appellant was made aware of his erratic driving, the
fact he was driving without his rear lights turned on, alcohol was in plain
view in the car and there had been a conversation concerning his alcohol
consumption.  Apart from explicitly advising Mr. Gomez that he was being
investigated for a possible drinking and driving offence, there is little more
that Cst. Jaggon could have done to make the Appellant aware of the direction
of the investigation.
[82]          
With respect to any
finding of a s. 9 breach, Sgt. Balasundaram’s decision to continue Mr. Gomez’
detention was at a minimum done with knowledge of the Appellant’s confusion
regarding why he was at the police station, his unsteadiness and the high blood
alcohol readings.  This breach would also be at the low end
of the spectrum.
[83]          
The time period between Cst. Jaggon asking Mr. Gomez to exit his car and when
he was arrested for impaired driving was minimal.  There is no suggestion that
Mr. Gomez was not properly read his rights to counsel, nor that he did not have
the opportunity to speak with counsel prior to the intoxilyzer tests being
conducted.  Consequently, any impact on the Charter-protected interests
of the Appellant were short-lived and quickly rectified.
[84]          
The overholding (if
that were found to have occurred) lasted approximately 3.5 hours.  For the
reasons noted above regarding the seriousness of the breach, Sgt. Balasundaram
had, at a minimum good reason to keep Mr. Gomez for at least some time. 
There is no allegation there was anything untoward about the detention.  The
Appellant was simply left to “sleep it off”.  In the circumstances, the impact
of any s. 9 breach would be at the low end of the scale.
[85]          
Defence counsel conceded in her argument that the third Grant factor
would militate in favour of including the evidence given the serious impact
that drunk driving has on society and therefore, society’s interest in seeing
such cases adjudicated on their merits.
[86]          
In short, none of the Grant factors would lead to a conclusion in this case that
the evidence of the intoxilyzer results should be excluded.  The cumulative
effect of the breaches, would not, in the circumstances of this case, change
that result.
[87]          
For all the reasons set
out above, the appeal is dismissed.
