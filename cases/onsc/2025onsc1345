[1]              
On February 24, 2025, the Court of Appeal remitted
this matter back to this Court to alter the provisions of the Final Order to
provide the father with the opportunity for a review of the parenting time orders
(D.F. v. R.W.F., 2025 ONCA 129). This review would allow for consideration of changes to the
supervised access terms, including the possibility of future unsupervised
access for the father.   As also noted by the Court of Appeal, this review should
take place no later than 12 months after February 24, 2025 and is to be without
the requirement that the father demonstrate a material change of circumstances.
[2]              
This Court therefore orders that the father may request
a review of the parenting time provisions of the Final Order, seeking changed
terms of supervision, or unsupervised parenting time. Such review shall take
place no later than 12 months after February 24, 2025. Any such review shall
proceed by way of the Motion to Change procedures detailed and permitted under
the Family Law Rules of the Family Court (Courts of Justice Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, O. Reg. 114/99) without a need to demonstrate a material
change of circumstances.
[3]              
Any subsequent request to vary the parenting
time orders shall be commenced by way of the Motion to Change procedures in the
Family Law Rules of the Family Court and which will include the requirement
to demonstrate a material change of circumstances.
[4]              
As also noted by the Court of Appeal, any such
determination of whether there are changed circumstances should be sensitive to
the fact that these parenting orders involve an adult child who cannot withdraw
from parental charge and age out of the order.
