Before the court is a motion for a determination
of an issue before trial relating to a question of law pursuant to Rule
21.01(1)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure[1].
[2]              
The question put to me on this motion is whether,
pursuant to section 239(1) of the Insurance Act[2], the “personal”
consent of the co-owner is required for a motor vehicle policy to provide
insurance coverage for liability imposed by law arising from the use of an
automobile insured under the policy.
[3]              
Further to my earlier order, the parties filed an Agreed Statement of
Facts:
[4]              
This dispute is between Economical Insurance, which issued a policy of
insurance to Ms. Malcolm, and Allstate Insurance Company of Canada, which
insured the Plaintiff, Sarah Nowakowski, pursuant to the OPCF 44R (Family
Protection Endorsement) on her own policy of insurance. Ms. Nowakowski and
Allstate are the moving parties and Ms. Campbell supports their position.

Automobile insurance is compulsory in Ontario pursuant to the Compulsory
Automobile Insurance Act[3]. 
The purpose of this legislation is to protect victims of automobile
accidents “from having no means of seeking damages from persons who might have
caused those damages without having the protection of automobile insurance”.[4]
[6]              
The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for accidents caused by its
operation under s. 192 of the Highway Traffic Act[5]
except where subsection (2) applies, which provides as follows:
[7]              
The purpose of s. 192(2) was noted in Fernandes v. Araujo, quoting
Gillese J. in Finlayson[6]
v. GMAC Leasco Ltd. at para. 21:
[8]              
If the motor vehicle is driven by a person who has the owner’s consent
and is involved in an accident, s. 3.2 of the Ontario Automobile Policy (OAP)
provides coverage: “You are covered when you, or anyone else in possession of a
described automobile with your consent, uses or operates it.  We will consider
these other people insured persons.” If there is no consent (express or implied),
the vehicle owner is not held liable for the actions of the unauthorized driver.
 The vehicle is treated as uninsured.[8]
[9]              
The Insurance Act mandates a scheme to provide for limited
insurance coverage where the operation of an uninsured automobile injures a
person.  The coverage is provided by the person’s own insurer, but coverage is
limited to the minimum required by s. 251 of the Insurance Act, which is
$200,000 for liability claims.[9]
[10]          
To mitigate the consequences of being injured by an uninsured or
underinsured motor vehicle, purchasers of automobile insurance in Ontario can
buy, for an additional premium, added coverage known as the OPCF 44R (Family
Protection Endorsement).[10] 
The Plaintiff in this case purchased such coverage from Allstate.
[11]          
Section 239(1) of the Insurance Act is the
legislative provision which gives effect to the OAP:
[12]          
Simply put, s. 239(1) states that an owner’s policy
insures the named person and anyone else who drives their vehicle with their consent.
[13]          
Economical takes the position that for its policy to respond, Ms.
Malcolm’s “personal” consent was required. It relies primarily upon a 1960 case
called Barham v. Marsden[12]
which was decided pursuant to the former s. 50(1) of the Highway Traffic Act[13]:
[14]          
The court in Barham decided that where the co-owner did not
provide his consent personally to the third-party driver, the co-owner was not
vicariously liable for the loss.  However, when Barham was decided, the
motor vehicle policy coverage section of the Insurance Act[14]
read:
[15]          
In 1980 the Insurance Act[15]
was amended to read:
[16]          
At the time Barham was decided, motor vehicle policies only
provided insurance coverage to the named insured while “personally in control
as driver or occupant”. The issue of “consent” to someone else driving the vehicle
therefore did not arise.
[17]          
In Collins v. Wright[16],
decided in 1988, the court was faced with a similar fact situation to ours.  Prior
to the accident, a woman purchased a car, registered it in her name, and purchased
a policy of insurance. Her son was listed as a principal driver.  The son
agreed that only the two of them could drive the car. They also agreed that he
would pay her for the car and that ultimately the car would be transferred to
him.  The son made some payments and took the car with him when he moved out of
his mother’s home.  He then loaned it to his girlfriend, who was involved in an
accident.
[18]          
The court followed Barham and concluded that pursuant to s.
209(1) of the Insurance Act[17],
because the mother did not “personally” provide her consent, the insurance
policy provided no coverage to the girlfriend.
[19]          
In 1990, s. 209(1) was amended to remove the word “personally” such that
s. 239(1) now reads, “who with the named person’s consent drives”; the
rest of the section is identical.
[20]          
The parties agree that in the 34 years since the removal of the word
“personally”, Collins has not been referred to or been followed in any
decisions related to the interpretation of the consent provision of the current
s. 239(1).
[21]          
The moving parties take the position that the removal of the word
“personally” from the operative section of the Insurance Act is fatal to
Economical’s position because its duty to respond and indemnify does not arise
from the vicarious liability provisions of the Highway Traffic Act[18],
but rather from its statutory and contractual obligations to respond to the
loss pursuant to section 239(1) of the Insurance Act.  In other words,
the duty to respond arises independently from the current vicarious liability
provision of the Highway Traffic Act. I am urged to conclude that the
effect of the 1990 amendment to the Insurance Act is that under current
law, for a motor vehicle policy of insurance to respond to a loss where the
driver was not a named insured under the policy, the driver now only requires
the named insured’s “consent” to drive the insured vehicle, and not the named
insured’s “personal consent”.
[22]          
Unlike when Collins was decided, consent under section 239(1) can
be delegated to another individual without the named insured’s knowledge and
even contrary to their express wishes:  Findlayson v. GMAC Leaseco Ltd.[19]. 
The “consent” of the named insured flows from the named insured through an
intermediary to another individual drive and can be express, implied or both.[20]
[23]          
The Court of Appeal, in Cummings v. Budget Car Rentals Toronto[21]
considered the status of section 239(1) in the context of the vicarious
liability provisions of the Highway Traffic Act.
[24]          
In Cummings, the owner of a motor vehicle (a rental company) consented
to the possession of its vehicle to an individual who then loaned it to a
third-party. Although the main issue before the court was whether the insurer
had a duty to defend, one of the questions posed for determination was whether
s. 192 of the Highway Traffic Act applied in determining whether the driver was
driving with the owner’s consent within the meaning of the insurance policy and
s. 239(1) of the Insurance Act.
[25]          
When answering this question, the Court of Appeal stated, in part:
[26]          
The Court of Appeal then stated:
[27]          
In my view, the Court of Appeal left open the door for this court to
find that section 239(1) provides coverage without determination of whether the
Highway Traffic Act also applies. Cummings makes it clear that
there are two separate and independent schemes which interpret “consent” in the
context of motor vehicle liability, such that section 239(1) of the Insurance
Act operates independently from section 192(2) of the Highway Traffic
Act.  While normally these sections operate in tandem, in this case, which
is particular on its facts, they diverge.
[28]          
The problem in this case is much simpler than as framed by counsel.
[29]          
The parties agree that Ms. Malcolm and Mr. Le Brun were registered co-owners
of the vehicle.  Although Mr. Le Brun was not listed as a named insured on
the Economical policy, section 239(1) is triggered as soon as the named insured
(Ms. Malcolm) gives express or implied consent to any intermediary, who
then gives express or implied consent to the driver. Implicit and incident to
co-ownership is Mr. Le Brun’s right to possess the vehicle with Ms. Malcolm’s
consent, otherwise his ownership would be meaningless.  As a result, pursuant
to s. 192(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, Ms. Malcolm’s consent flowed
through Mr. Le Brun to Ms. Campbell.
[30]          
Therefore, I determine that pursuant to s. 192(2) of
the Highway Traffic Act, and therefore s. 239(1) of the Insurance Act,
the “personal” consent of Ms. Malcolm was not required for her motor
vehicle policy to provide insurance coverage for liability imposed by law
arising from the use or operation of the vehicle by Ms. Campbell.
[31]          
If the parties cannot agree on costs, they may make cost submissions limited
to three pages (exclusive of Bills of Costs) within two weeks of the release of
these reasons.  There shall be no right of reply without leave of the court.  If
I do not receive submissions, I will assume the parties have settled the issue.
