[1]             
Following a 13 day trial, four of which were
half days, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.  The parties were
invited to provide their submissions on costs to me in writing.
[2]              
For the reasons that follow I award the
defendants costs in the total amount of $155,000.
[3]              
The successful party is presumptively entitled
to costs: Sims-Howarth v. Bilcliffe, 2000 ONSC 22584 at paragraphs 13.
[4]              
In the present case, the
Defendant was entirely successful and is entitled to an award of costs.
[5]              
The Defendants seek their
costs on a substantial indemnity basis, arguing that they were entirely
successful, and that the Plaintiff did not accept two offers which were made
more than a year prior to trial, and prior to most of the trial preparation.
[6]             
The Defendants’ bill of costs is $166,208.21, on
a partial indemnity basis, and $219,589.41 on a substantial indemnity basis.
[7]              
In Falsetto v. Falsetto, 2022 ONSC 5089,
the court held that where the plaintiff recovers no damages the Court may fix
costs on a substantial indemnity scale from the date of the defendant’s first
offer: para 37.
[8]              
In Lalani Properties et al v. Intact
Insurance/2160943 Ontario v. Intact Insurance et al, 2024 ONSC 892 Vella J.
also awarded substantial indemnity costs after the date of the defendant’s
first offer indicating that this was based on the court’s discretion without
reference to r. 49.10.
[9]              
She indicated that this approach promotes the
“policy objective underlying offers to settle generally; namely, to encourage
settlement with the risk that if the offer is better than the result, the
recipient has an enhanced cost consequence.”
[10]          
As well, I take into account direction from
appellate courts that although the court has the discretion to award
substantial indemnity costs, such costs are “rare and exceptional” and only
warranted where there has been reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct
on the part of a party: see DUCA Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. v.
Bozzo, 2010 ONSC 4601, at para. 5; Foulis v. Robinson (1978), 1978 CanLII 1307 (ON CA), 21
O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.); and most recently Mars Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash &
Carry Inc., 2018 ONCA 239, 140 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 43.
[11]          
Pursuant to s. 131(1) of the Courts of
Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, costs are in the discretion of the
court. Rule 57 of the Rules sets out the factors which courts should
have regard to when awarding costs. I have reviewed those factors here.
[12]          
The overall objective is “to fix an amount that
is fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful party to pay in the particular
proceeding, rather than an amount fixed by the actual costs incurred by the
successful litigant”: Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier (2002), 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON CA), 21
C.C.E.L. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 4; Boucher v. Public
Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291
(C.A.), at para. 26; Clarington (Municipality) v. Blue Circle Canada Inc.,
2009 ONCA 722, 100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 52; and G.C. v. Ontario (Attorney
General), 2014 ONSC 1191, at para. 5.
[13]          
On
July 12, 2023 the Defendants offered to settle the civil case by paying $50,000
to the Plaintiff from the proceeds of 227 Rymal Road, with the balance to the Defendants,
and each party bearing their own legal fees.
[14]          
The Defendants later made another offer to
settle this matter in conjunction with the family litigation, for a payment of
$100,000 to the Plaintiff on account of both matters. When this second offer was
made, the initial July 12, 2023 offer was not revoked. I agree with the
Defendants that there is no reason to conclude that subsequent offer either
cancelled or changed the effect of the July 12, 2023 offer.
[15]          
After receiving the Defendants’ reply
submissions, I was in receipt of a note from Plaintiff’s counsel, sent by email
and copied to counsel for the Defendants, advising that he finds paragraph 2 of
the Defendants’ cost submissions may “impugn his integrity”, and he requested
an opportunity to make submissions in that regard.  I decline his request.
Paragraph 2 of the Defendants’ reply submissions read:
[16]          
I do not accept that this impugns the integrity
of counsel, as it is virtually the exact terminology that Plaintiff’s counsel
used in his submissions about the Defendants’ costs, wherein he made the
following statements: “their bill appears inflated”; “the bill overstates the
fees charged” “the dockets appear inflated because many entries are recorded as
whole hours and all trial days are the same length”.
[17]          
In my decision on the trial, I found the
Plaintiff’s evidence to have lacked credibility in every respect, and as a
result, she was entirely unsuccessful.  This was not a situation of divided
success.
[18]          
I have balanced this in relation to the fact
that the Plaintiff’s case was presented in an organized fashion, and that much
of the excess time spent which far extended the originally estimated length of
the trial of only 5 days, was in relation to the Defendants’ conduct of the
case.
[19]          
I have considered that Counsel for the Defendants
made a number of attempts at settlement, including the Rule 49 offer of July,
2023, which I find was not nullified by the subsequent offer, though it makes
little difference if it were.  The Defendants were entirely successful in
defending the Plaintiff’s claims, faring better than the offers made to the
Plaintiff.
[20]          
In considering the unsuccessful Plaintiff’s reasonable
expectation as to costs, I have reviewed the Plaintiff’s bill of costs, and her
prior bills of costs, and her other conduct. The Plaintiff admits that they
advised the Defendants in January 2024 that their mid trial partial indemnity
costs at that time were $100,000.
[21]          
The Defendants point out that the Plaintiff’s
costs of her successful 1.5 day motion were over $19,000.  I agree with the
Defendants that the Plaintiff’s bill of costs on a 1.5 day motion were
proportionately higher than any of the bills of cost before me on the trial.
[22]          
The Offers to settle were in July and November
2023, well ahead of the time when trial preparation would have begun.
[23]          
I also agree the submission of Plaintiff’s
counsel as they related to the Defendants’ conduct of the trial being
inefficient and having resulted in the trial running longer than necessary. In
my view, the trial ought to have been significantly more efficient from the
Defendants’ perspective.  Where there were delays in starting on time, or failure
to ensure prompt availability of witnesses, and failure to make use of full
court days, those delays lay disproportionately at the feet of the Defendants.
[24]          
I have considered also that the Defendants
brought an entirely unsuccessful motion regarding hearsay evidence during the
trial, for which they appear to have included well over 20 hours of preparation
in their docket.  Their unpreparedness to address the motion required that the
matter be addressed over several days.  The motion was unsuccessful, and I
found that the evidence did not approach the standard which would have been
required in arguing an exception to the hearsay rule.  In total the motion
easily accounted for more than one full day of court time, in addition to significant
related preparation.  The costs of this motion should not be recovered.  I
balance this against the Plaintiff’s unsuccessful motion brought at the
beginning of trial, which took up the better part of a half day.
[25]          
The Defendants concede that the Plaintiff is
impecunious which “may be one of the factors the court could consider in the
exercise of the courts discretion under S. 131 of the Courts of Justice Act in
determining a reasonable amount of costs”: Agius v Home Depot, 2011 ONSC 5272
at para 17.
[26]          
The dispute at trial was over a 55% interest in real
property, or $416,900, although I note that the Plaintiff claimed 100% interest
in the property during her testimony at trial. In the circumstances known to
me, I find that the case was significant to the parties.
[27]          
The factual matrix was complex, but the legal
issues in the case were of moderate complexity.
[28]          
Although I did not accept the Plaintiff’s
evidence, I do not find that her conduct rises to the point of being scandalous
and outrageous, and, in consideration of everything presented, including, inter
alia, the length and complexity of the trial, the Offers to Settle, the Defendants’
complete success in defending against the Plaintiff’s claims, balanced against
the inefficient conduct of the case, in my view, I decline to exercise my
discretion to order costs on an increased scale, and find that the proper scale
of costs is on a partial indemnity basis.
[29]          
I find that a reasonable and proportionate award
of costs in all of the circumstances here, is a cost award in favour of the
defendants on a partial indemnity scale, somewhat reduced to reflect the
concerns indicated above.  I award the Defendants their costs in the amount of $155,000.00
inclusive, less an $8,500 costs award made in favour of the Plaintiff on
September 8, 2023, if it has not been paid at the time of the release of these
reasons.
[30]          
The Defendants urge me to order that those costs
may be recovered against the proceeds of a property held in trust in relation
to the family proceedings, given their belief that the Plaintiff is impecunious.
I decline to make an order to impact property held in trust in relation to another
proceeding.
[31]          
The Plaintiff shall pay $155,000 to the
Defendants, inclusive of all costs, including disbursements and HST, less the
$8,500.00 costs set-off from Justice Broad’s outstanding September 8, 2023
endorsement (if it has not been paid), within 30 days of the date herein.
