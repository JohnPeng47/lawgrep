[1]               This is a motion for summary judgment under Rule 20.01(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure brought by the Plaintiffs, Mark Reid and Virginia Foulds, for judgment against the Defendants, Ibukun Abass and Omalara Ibukun-Abass, in the amount of $149,000. The motion relates to the Plaintiffs’ action for damages arising out of the Defendant Ibukun Abass’ failure to close the purchase of a property pursuant to an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (APS) dated February 24, 2022.
[2]               The Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of the difference between the agreed purchase price ($999,000) and the price at which the property was subsequently sold ($850,000).
[3]               What makes this case unusual is that the property was subsequently sold to the Defendants, Ibukun Abass and Omalara Ibukun-Abass, following a further agreement between the parties dated July 7, 2022 (the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement).
[4]               The issue on this summary judgment motion relates to the interpretation of the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement and its effect on the right of the Plaintiffs to sue the Defendants for damages for breach of the February 24, 2022 APS.
[5]               On February 24, 2022, the Plaintiffs entered into an APS with Mr. Abass in which Mr. Abass agreed to purchase their home for $999,000. Mr. Abass was to pay an initial deposit of $80,000, to be held in trust, and the closing was scheduled for July 4, 2022.
[6]               On February 25, 2022, an amendment was made to the Agreement for Mr. Abass to pay a supplementary deposit of $6,000.00. The additional deposit was paid because Mr. Abass had failed to pay the initial $80,000.00 in accordance with the APS. Ultimately, $86,000.00 was paid as a deposit.
[7]               On April 6, 2022, a second amendment was made to the APS to change the closing date from July 4, 2022 to June 27, 2022.
[8]               On June 21, 2022, Mr. Abass’ lawyer wrote to the Plaintiffs’ lawyer to request a reduction of the purchase price from $999,000 to $850,000. He explained that his client was in a “tough situation” because the appraisal report for the property valued the property at only $795,000, and his client could not obtain financing for the APS amount of $999,000. He also asked to amend the closing date to July 18, 2022, to provide his client time to obtain the financing from the bank.  The letter stated:
[9]               The Plaintiffs’ lawyer rejected the proposed price reduction, and took the position that Mr. Abass’ lawyer’s letter was an anticipatory breach. She responded on June 22, 2022:
[10]           When 5:00 p.m. came and went without any reply from Mr. Abass’ lawyer, the Plaintiffs’ lawyer wrote to Mr. Abass’ lawyer again to advise:
[11]           On June 27, 2022, the scheduled closing date, Mr. Abass did not deliver closing funds or documents. The transaction did not close as scheduled.
[12]           I will pause my summary of the facts to address the legal positions of the parties as of June 27, 2022.
[13]           I agree with the Plaintiffs that Mr. Abass’ lawyer’s letter of June 21, 2022 was a repudiation of the APS and indicated an intention not to close on June 27, 2022. It is clear from the Plaintiffs’ lawyer’s reply on June 22, 2022, that they interpreted the June 21, 2022 letter as a repudiation of the APS. Mr. Abass’ lawyer was given an opportunity to clarify if this was not his position, and he did not do so.
[14]           The law relating to anticipatory breach of contract was summarized by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Spirent Communications of Ottawa Limited v. Quake Technologies (Canada) Inc., 2008 ONCA 92, at para. 37:
[15]           See also: Remedy Drug Store Co. Inc. v. Farnham, 2015 ONCA 576, at para. 47.
[16]           Thus, as of June 22, 2022, and certainly no later than the scheduled closing date of June 27, 2022, the Defendant was in breach of the APS. At that point, the Plaintiffs were presumptively entitled to retain the $86,000 deposit, re-list the property for sale, and sue Mr. Abass for the difference between the sale price agreed to in the APS and the final sale price, less the deposit. In these circumstances, the vendor has no obligation to accept the lower price offered by the defaulting purchaser in an effort to mitigate damages.
[17]           In Azzarello v. Shawqi, 2019 ONCA 820, the Court of Appeal held that it was not a failure to mitigate when an innocent vendor refuses the defaulting purchaser’s revised terms to purchase the property at a lower price. The Court of Appeal stated at paras. 37-40:
[18]           See also: Bang v. Sebastian, 2019 ONCA 501, at para. 5: “The duty to mitigate does not compel the seller of residential property to abandon a perfectly valid agreement and accept a substantially reduced price just because the purchaser decides to abort the valid agreement because of a falling real estate market”.
[19]           I also note that Mr. Abass’ wife, the Defendant Omalara Ibukun-Abass, was not a party to the APS, and, as such, could have no liability for breaching the APS.
[20]           On June 29, 2022, the Plaintiffs’ lawyer wrote to the Defendant’s lawyer to advise that the Plaintiffs were prepared to relist the property and pursue Mr. Abass for damages, but he would make “one final offer”. His letter stated:
[21]           The Defendant’s lawyer signed the offer on the Defendant’s behalf, but amended the completion date (clause 2) to read July 28, 2022. This amendment was not acceptable to the Plaintiffs, so the June 29, 2022 offer did not become the agreement.
[22]           On its face, the terms of the June 29, 2022 Offer meant that the Plaintiffs were offering to sell the property to Mr. Abass for $850,000, but they reserved the right to sue Mr. Abass for the difference between the new price and the original price. In other words, the property would still cost Mr. Abass $999,000. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in Azzarello: “This would offer no financial advantage to the defaulting party as that party would be obliged to pay the same amount, either way.”
[23]           Further negotiations continued, with proposals going back and forth in June and July.
[24]           Finally, on July 7, 2022, the Plaintiffs’ lawyer made the following offer which, with one minor correction, was agreed to by Mr. Abass:
[25]           Attached to the July 7 letter was the “Irrevocable Direction” referenced at clause 4. That Direction, which by the terms of clause 4 was “part of the terms of this extension”, provided:
[26]           Mr. Abass signed both the July 7, 2022 offer and the Irrevocable Direction on July 7, 2022, correcting only the reference to “June 30, 2022”, in clause 7, which was changed to July 8, 2022, since June 30 had already past.
[27]           There is no dispute between the parties that the July 7, 2022 offer and the Irrevocable Direction are, together, the terms of their agreement (the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement). To the extent that the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement referentially incorporates the APS (see clause 11), the APS continued as part of the agreement.
[28]           On July 19, 2022, an amendment was made to the Extension Agreement to reflect the following: (a) the buyers were to be Ibukun and Omalara collectively; (b) Ibukun and Omalara collectively acknowledged the terms of the Extension Agreement and agreed to be bound by those terms; (c) other than the amendments made by the Extension Agreement and this amendment, the parties agreed that all terms of the original Agreement were to remain in effect; and (d) time was to remain of the essence.
[29]           Rule 20.04(2)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 provides: “The court shall grant summary judgment if the court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence.”
[30]           In the present case, both parties agree that this dispute is amenable to a motion for summary judgment and that the legal issues can be resolved without a trial. There are no relevant facts in dispute. The dispute in this case comes down to the interpretation of clause 10 of the July 7 Extension Agreement, and, in particular, the phrase “failure to close on the scheduled closing date”.
[31]           On a motion for summary judgment, the judge may grant judgment in favour of a responding party, even in the absence of a cross-motion for such relief, so long as it is within the scope of the motion: Singh v. Trump, 2016 ONCA 747, at para. 147 and cases cited therein.
[32]           Accordingly, I agree with both parties that this is an appropriate case for summary judgment.
[33]           The Plaintiffs take the position that the phrase “failure to close on the scheduled closing date” is a reference to the original closing date in the APS, ie. June 27, 2022. This means that even though they agreed to sell the house to Mr. Abass for $850,000, they reserved the right to sue Mr. Abass[1] for the difference between the new price and the original price.
[34]           The Plaintiffs rely on para. 36 of the Court of Appeal’s decision in Azzarello, where the Court explained that, even if the vendor agreed to pay the reduced price, the purchaser would still be liable to the vendor for the difference unless the vendor released the purchaser from their obligation under the original APS: “Unless the respondents [vendors] agreed to sell to the appellant [purchasers] for a 10% reduction, and at the same time released him from his obligation to pay the original price, the respondents could still sue the appellant for the difference”.
[35]           In the present case, the Plaintiffs argue that they did not release the Mr. Abass from his obligations under the APS. To the contrary, they expressly reserved the right to bring an action for damages.
[36]           The Defendants take the position that, reading the contract as a whole, the phrase “failure to close on the scheduled closing date” refers to the extended closing date in the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement, ie. July 28, 2022. Thus, if the Defendants failed to close on July 28, 2022, the Plaintiffs could still sue Mr. Abass for the “originally agreed-upon amount”, but if they did close on July 28, 2022, Mr. Abass would not be liable for damages under the original APS.
[37]           When interpreting any contract, the “overriding concern is to determine the intent of the parties and the scope of their understanding”: by reading “the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of formation of the contract.”: Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, at para. 47. The primary object of contract interpretation is to give effect to the intention of the parties at the time of contract formation:  Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, at para. 45.
[38]           In Plan Group v. Bell Canada, 2009 ONCA 548, 96 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 37, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that a commercial contract should be interpreted: (i) as a whole, by giving meaning to all the terms of a contract to avoid an interpretation that would render any term ineffective; (ii) by determining the intention of the parties with reference to the words used in the contract; (iii) with regard to objective evidence of the factual matrix underlying the negotiation of the contract, but without reference to subjective intention; and (iv) to the extent that there is any ambiguity in the contract, in a fashion that accords with sound commercial principles and good business sense and that avoids a commercial absurdity.
[39]           The Court of Appeal has cautioned against looking to negotiations to interpret a contract. The basic principles of commercial contract interpretation were summarized in Salah v. Timothy’s Coffees of the World Inc., 2010 ONCA 673, 268 O.A.C. 279. At para. 16:
[40]           See also: Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., 1998 CanLII 791 (SCC), [1998] 2 SCR 129, at paras. 54-55; The Canada Trust Company v. Browne, 2012 ONCA 862, 115 O.R. (3d) 287, at para. 71.
[41]           In Weyerhaeuser Company Limited v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2017 ONCA 1007, the Court stated, at para. 112:
[42]           This principle was also affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Sattva Capital Corp., at paras. 57 and 59, where the Court explained the limitation of “surrounding circumstances” as an aid to contractual interpretation:
[43]           In analysing this case, I do not doubt that the parties had entirely different subjective intentions. The issue is whether that intention is reflected in “the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning”.
[44]           Looking at the contract as a whole, I accept the interpretation advanced by the Defendants.
[45]           Firstly, I start with clauses 2, 5 and 8 of the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement, all of which refer to the “original closing date”. This suggests that where the Extension Agreement intends to reference the June 27, 2022 closing date, it references the “original closing date”.
[46]           In contrast, clause 5 refers to “the closing date”, and it is irrefutable that this refers to the July 28, 2022 closing date.
[47]           Clause 9 introduces another term, the “extended closing date”, which, like clause 5, means the July 28, 2022 closing date.
[48]           The clause at issue - clause 10 - does not refer to either the “original closing date” or the “extended closing date”, but refers to the “scheduled closing date”. As of July 7, 2022, the “scheduled closing date” was July 28, 2022.
[49]           This interpretation is reinforced by placing clause 10 immediately after clause 9. Clause 9 imposes a consequence on the purchaser “in the event your clients are unable to close this transaction by the extended closing date.” Clause 10 appears to impose a second consequence “for your clients’ failure to close on the scheduled closing date”. Reading clauses 9 and 10 together, I would interpret them as referring to the same closing date, ie. the extended closing date of July 28, 2022. I would not interpret clause 10 as referring back to the “original closing date” referenced in clauses 2, 5 and 8.
[50]           This interpretation is further reinforced by the “Irrevocable Direction”, which was incorporated as “part of the terms of this extension” by clause 4 of the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement. The last sentence of the “Irrevocable Direction” states: “The Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the forfeiture of the above deposit to the Vendor shall in no way preclude the vendor from suing the Purchasers for any and all damages that they will incur in relation to the Purchasers not being in a position to close the subject transaction on July 28, 2022.” [Emphasis added.] Reading this sentence together with clause 10, I would interpret both clauses as referring to the same closing date, and the Purchaser being liable “for any and all damages” if the Purchaser failed to close on that date. Otherwise, the last sentence of the “Irrevocable Direction” makes no sense, because, if the Plaintiff’s interpretation is accepted, Mr. Abass remained liable for “any and all damages” even if he did close on July 28, 2022.
[51]           Finally, to the extent that the term “scheduled closing date” is ambiguous, it is the language chosen by the Plaintiffs’ lawyer, who drafted the July 7, 2022 offer, and should be interpreted contra proferentum. The Plaintiffs’ lawyer could have easily avoided any ambiguity by using the same term used in clauses 2, 5, and 8: “original closing date”.
[52]           Accordingly, I accept the interpretation advanced by the Defendants in this case: reading the July 7, 2022 Extension Agreement, “as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning”, Mr. Abass was released from his obligation to pay the originally agreed-upon amount if he closed the transaction for the lower amount by the extended closing date of July 28, 2022.
[53]           The Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is therefore dismissed, and summary judgment is granted in favour of the Defendants.
[54]           If the parties are not able to agree on costs, the Defendants may serve and file costs submissions not to exceed three pages, plus costs outline and any offers to settle, within 20 days of the release of this decision, and the Plaintiffs may serve and file responding costs submissions on the same terms within a further 15 days.
