     Ms.
Robson was successful in obtaining an order for the sale of property owned
jointly with Mr. Cote[1].
[2]    
     By
endorsement dated October 10, 2024, I directed the parties to submit written
costs submissions by certain dates. Ms. Robson delivered costs submissions. Mr.
Cote did not.
[3]    
     The
procedural history of this matter was summarized in my prior decision:
[4]    
     The
draft order that I directed was to issue stated that:
[5]    
     Ms.
Robson seeks costs on a full indemnity basis of $34,377 inclusive of
disbursements and HST. Included in these costs is the sum of $7,245 for “wasted
fees” for fees incurred in drafting a separation agreement. $27,132 is the
amount claimed for the motion and the drafting of the notice of motion, two
affidavits, factum, and draft order.
[6]    
     This
was not a complex motion, and the law is well settled. Responding materials
were not delivered. As noted, Mr. Cote’s conduct amounted to delay.
[7]    
      I
reviewed the dockets filed in support of the claim for costs of the motion and
note significant duplication of effort and work unrelated to the actual motion.
[8]    
     Keeping
in mind that costs are to be awarded generally based on what a party might
reasonably be expected to be called upon for a motion of this nature, I fix the
costs of this motion at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and HST.
