[1]             
On September 9, 2024, after the conclusion of a short judge-alone trial,
the accused, Sajeeth Vijayakumaran, was found guilty of three criminal
offences, namely: (1) the unlawful possession of a restricted firearm, namely a
handgun, together with readily accessible ammunition, without being the holder
of the requisite authorization, license, or registration certificate, contrary
to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, chap. C-46; (2) the
unlawful possession of a restricted handgun, while knowingly not the holder of
the requisite license or registration certificate, contrary to s. 92(1) of the Criminal
Code; and (3) the unlawful possession of a prohibited magazine, while
knowingly not the holder of the requisite license, contrary to s. 92(2) of the Criminal
Code.  These offences were committed by the accused in Toronto on or about
July 2, 2021.  I found the accused not guilty in relation to three other
alleged offences of “threatening.”  See: R. v. Vijayakumaran, 2024 ONSC
4396.
[2]             
  Essentially, following a heated verbal dispute between the accused and
his then girlfiend, Kirushika Anandaraja, she contacted the police and told
them that the accused possessed a handgun, that he kept inside a lockbox that
looked like a “book.”  She explained that she had seen the accused with the gun
at least twice in the recent past.  When the police executed a search warrant
at the home of the accused the following day, where he lived with his family, they
found and seized the handgun, magazine and ammunition, as well as the lockbox
that looked like a “book.”
[3]             
The accused now appears for sentencing in relation to his firearms
offences.  This date was selected, in part, to permit the accused to have some
wisdom teeth surgically removed, in Montreal, on February 12, 2025.  I
understand that this dental surgery had been scheduled for some time, and
something the accused medically needed, so we have all tried to accommodate his
request in this regard.
[4]             
At the sentencing hearing in this case, the Crown sought the imposition
of a three-year term of penitentiary imprisonment on the accused.  Defence
counsel contended that the accused should receive a conditional sentence of two
years less a day.  The parties, essentially, agreed that there were a number of
ancillary sentencing orders that should be imposed in this case.
[5]             
Ms. Kirushika Anandaraja testified that she dated the
accused, romantically, for approximately two years, starting sometime in 2019. 
She knew the other members of the accused’s family (i.e. his brother and his
parents), and had been to their home many times.
[6]             
Ms. Anandaraja testified that she had seen the
accused with a dark grey or black handgun on at least two occasions, probably a
couple of weeks before she called the police.  This happened once when they
were alone together in his bedroom, and once when they were alone together in
his car.  The accused just held the firearm – she never touched it – and he
kept it in a locked box that looked like a “book.”  She explained that the
accused “moved it around” in their house, but kept it in the metal box that was
locked with a “code.”  The complainant recognized the photographs of the
lockbox, when those photographs were taken by the police when the lockbox was
found in the recycling bin.  Ms. Anandaraja testified that she never saw anyone
else with that handgun.
[7]             
Ms. Anandaraja testified that the “incident” that led
to her call to the police took place on “Canada Day” in 2021.  According to the
complainant, she and the accused became engaged in an argument that day, during
which the accused threatened her, and indicated that he was also going to shoot
members of her family, including her grandmother and her brother.  The
complainant testified that, at the time the accused was making these threats to
her and her family, she was very concerned about these threats as she knew that
the accused had a gun.  Indeed, she had seen him in possession of a handgun
relatively recently.  In the result, later that day, she contacted the police
and told them about the gun and the unique lockbox.
[8]             
The police attended at the Toronto premises occupied by the accused, his
brother, and their two parents on July 2, 2021, with a search warrant.  During
the course of their execution of the search warrant, the police located and
seized a handgun, a magazine with some ammunition for the handgun, and a
lockbox that looked like a “book.”  More particularly, the
police discovered and seized the following:
[9]             
The police were not able to learn, specifically, how these various
seized items came to be in the location in which they were found.
[10]          While I
was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the alleged
“threatening” offences, I was entirely satisfied, beyond any reasonable doubt,
that the accused unlawfully possessed the firearm, the over-capacity magazine,
and the ammunition found by the police.  More particularly, I concluded that
the evidence showed, overwhelmingly, that after some type of verbal dispute
between the accused and Ms. Anandaraja, she contacted the
police and told them about the accused’s possession of the firearm in the
lockbox that looked like a “book” that she had seen recently.  In my view, Ms.
Anandaraja simply could not have known about the accused’s handgun and
the unique lockbox unless she saw them (as she fully and candidly explained in
her testimony).
[11]          I was also
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, on the late afternoon of July 1,
2021, the accused and the complainant exchanged words, and following their
heated argument, the accused became concerned that the complainant, who he knew
had seen him with the handgun and the unique lockbox, became concerned that she
might tell the police about them (as she did).  Accordingly, the accused
personally put his handgun, its magazine and its ammunition, in a large plastic
container, and hidden under some clothes, in his parent’s bedroom closet, and
he put the unique lockbox in the recycling bin just outside their house – where
all of these items were found by the police.  I was satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused did this try to distance himself (and thereby
insulate himself) from these incriminating items in the event that the
complainant contacted the police.
[12]          I also
concluded that the accused still had “constructive possession” of these
contraband items, according to s. 4(3)(ii) of the Criminal Code, as he
knowingly had them in a place (i.e. the closet of his parent’s bedroom, where
he had stored them), for the use or benefit of himself.  Having hidden them
there, the accused knew exactly what they were, he knew their precise location,
and he had full control over them.  In other words, the accused knew the
character of these things, knowingly put them in this particular location, and
intended to have those things in that place for his own use and/or benefit.  See:
R. v. Beaver, 1957 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1957] S.C.R. 531, 118 C.C.C. 129; R. v. Kocsis
(2001), 2001 CanLII 3593 (ON CA), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 564, 146 O.A.C. 383, at paras. 14-24; R. v. Pham
(2005), 2005 CanLII 44671 (ON CA), 77 O.R. (3d) 401, 203 C.C.C. (3d) 326 (C.A.), at para. 15; affirmed:
[2006] 1 S.C.R. 940, 2006 SCC 26; R. v. Chalk, 2007 ONCA 815, 227 C.C.C.

2020 ONCA 128, 149 O.R. (3d) 273, at paras. 44-53.
[13]          As I have
mentioned, I have also concluded that the accused, after his heated verbal
argument with the complainant, not only tried to hide his handgun, magazine and
ammunition in his parent’s bedroom closet, but he also tried to distance himself
from the unique lockbox that looked like a “book,” by putting it in the
recycling bin just outside their house.
[14]          I rejected
the entirely speculative, conjectural possibility (without any supporting
evidence), that, coincidentally, someone else (i.e. perhaps the accused’s
parents, or his brother) may have put the accused’s handgun, magazine and
ammunition in the parent’s bedroom closet, under the clothes, and put the
unique lockbox in the recycling bin (by itself) sometime on July 1-2, 2021, coincidentally
right after the heated verbal argument between the accused and the complainant had
ended.  See: R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000,
at paras. 18-22, 28, 30, 32-34, 35-42, 50.
[15]          I ordered
the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report in this case, and one was
helpfully prepared.  It outlined many of the personal circumstances of the accused. 
While defence counsel talked about the possible eventual preparation of a Morris
Report and has suggested that the sentencing of the accused should be
postponed for the year or so it would likely take to obtain such an additional Report,
I refused to wait for such a lengthy period of time for the preparation of such
an additional Report.  In my view, the Pre-Sentence Report and
the submissions of counsel were sufficient to provide me with all of the
relevant personal circumstances of the accused, so that they could be properly
and fully considered in connection with the sentencing of the accused.
[16]          The first
exhibit filed on the sentencing hearing was the Pre-Sentence Report that
had been prepared in this case.  That document was, however, slightly edited by
defence counsel, with the consent of the Crown, in a number of respects. 
However, this edited Pre-Sentence Report still provided the court with
considerable information concerning the personal circumstances of the accused,
including all of the following.
[17]          The
accused is now just over 29 years of age.  He is a Canadian citizen.  His
parents are originally from Sri Lanka, but they immigrated to Canada more than
40 years ago.  The accused was born in Scarborough, Ontario.  He has a younger
brother.  While he is not especially close to his parents or his brother, the
accused claims that he has a good relationship with each of them, despite the serious
financial challenges his family faced while he was growing up.  I must note,
however, that while the author of the Pre-Sentence Report “reached out”
to the accused’s mother and brother, both of them “declined to participate,
citing the emotional toll the case has already taken on them.”
[18]          The
accused claimed that their family’s problematic financial situation caused him
to become angry and get into “fights” in his youth.
[19]          The
accused now lives in Montreal, where he resides with his paternal cousin and
his family.  The accused moved there in 2021, after he was “granted bail” in
the present case.
[20]          The
accused is single, but he has a long-term relationship with his current girlfriend,
a nurse who lives and works in Montreal, who he first met in 2021.  He has no
dependents.  They both describe their romantic relationship as “very good” and
they are planning a future together.
[21]          The
accused has a criminal record.  First, on March 14, 2019, he was convicted, in
Toronto, of driving with more than 80 mgs. of alcohol in his blood, and he was
sentenced to a $1,300 fine and prohibited from driving for one year.  Second,
on September 15, 2022, the accused was convicted, in Newmarket, of impaired
operation of a conveyance (by drugs or alcohol, or a combination of both) and
given a four-month long conditional sentence, followed by a 23-month term of
probation, and prohibited from the operation of a motor vehicle for three
years.
[22]          The accused
claimed that, in his younger years, the police were frequently “harassing the
brown guys” (including him), for “no reason,” at a time when “racial profiling”
seemed to be “legal.”
[23]          The
accused agreed, however, that the neighbourhood that he grew up in, in
Scarborough, was the “hood,” there was “crime everywhere,” and the people he “grew
up with were up to no good.”  The accused candidly admitted that, in his
younger years, he was personally not doing the “right thing.”  He admitted
that, “back in the day” (starting when he was in grade 10), he would “smoke
weed” and “drink,” get “high” and “do stupid things.”  He thought it was “a
gateway to temporary happiness.”
[24]          The
accused emphasized how much he has changed since those former days, and he
claims to have learned many “lessons.”  More specifically, he claims to have
learned that “clearly alcohol is a problem” for him.  Now he enjoys
“pro-social” activities, such as “playing basketball, rugby, volleyball and
track.”  The accused completed a Martial Arts program in 2011, and holds
several certifications, including Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training
(2017), Improvement in Respect, Self-Control and Self-Discipline (2011) and
Conflict Resolution Development (2008).  The accused was also an Assistant
Coach at a senior public school for a number of months in 2011, and he
volunteered as an Election Enthusiast for three months in 2011.
[25]            The
accused attended high school in north-eastern Toronto.  While he admitted that
he had “faced some suspensions” there for “fighting and smoking weed,” he
claimed to have obtained “decent grades” and had “pretty good” relationships
with his teachers.  Further, the accused received a Diploma in “Protection,
Security and Investigation” from Durham College in 2017.
[26]          In terms
of his employment history, the accused claims to have had a series of jobs, starting
with a retail company in 2012, then working with a car rental company, then
working as a cashier at a supermarket, then as a customer service
representative and manager at a fitness club.  Currently, the accused is
employed as a warehouse assistant with his cousin’s trucking company.  The
accused says that he has never been on welfare and works consistently to
support himself financially.
[27]          Currently,
the accused also volunteers at a Y.M.C.A. in Montreal for a “couple of hours
each week” to assist with activities like basketball.  The accused also
volunteered at “Evolu Jeunes,” for some 50 hours of “community service” in
2024, helping them with the preparation and facilitation of various “sports
activities.”
[28]          According
to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report, the accused presented as
“cooperative, respectful and engaged,” answering “most” of her questions in an
“open and forthcoming” manner.  However, the accused has expressed no remorse
whatsoever for his possession of the firearm, over-capacity magazine and
ammunition.  Indeed, any passages in the Pre-Sentence Report which
suggested any remorse on his part were edited out, at the insistence of his
lawyer.  Further, when I inquired, through his lawyer, as to why the accused
had this firearm, magazine and ammunition, he simply refused to answer, as was
his right.
[29]          Of course,
this complete absence of remorse by the accused cannot be viewed as any type of
aggravating factor on the issue of sentence, but rather may only be properly
viewed as the absence of a potential mitigating factor.  That is how I have
viewed it.  See: R. v. Kozy (1990), 1990 CanLII 2625 (ON CA), 74 O.R. (2d) 545, 58 C.C.C. (3d) 500
(C.A.), at pp. 505-506; R. v. Anderson (1992), 1992 CanLII 6002 (BC CA), 16 B.C.A.C. 14, 74 C.C.C.
(3d) 523 (C.A.), at pp. 535-536; R. v. Valentini (1999), 1999 CanLII 1885 (ON CA), 43 O.R. (3d)
178, 132 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (C.A.), at para. 80-85; R. v. L (C.), 2013 ONSC
277, [2013] O.J. No. 114, at paras. 80-81; R. v. Reeve, 2020, ONCA 381,
151 O.R. (3d) 65, at paras. 9-22; R. v. F.A., 2022 ONSC 5696, at para.
48; R. v. Kovacs, 2024 ONSC 1586, at para. 27; Affirmed: 2025 ONCA 49.
[30]          Defence
counsel filed a series of letters, written by the family and friends of the
accused, outlining the various traits of his positive character.  These
letters, collectively viewed, describe the accused as a kind, caring, thoughtful,
supportive, selfless, nurturing, and considerate individual, who is eager to
take care of others, including his family.  Indeed, the accused has been
described as a “loving family man.”  His current girlfriend says that the
accused has “strong moral values.”  These letters suggest that the accused is,
at his core, a “good human being” who “deserves another chance” and who should
be shown “compassion” and “leniency” in sentencing, so that he will be able to
continue on a “positive path” and “continue making positive contributions to
society.”
[31]          More than
half of these supporting character letters suggest, in one way or another, that
it is “quite evident” that [the accused] “expresses” and “feels deep remorse”
for his actions and “regrets” the decisions that have led him to where he is
today.  In response to these comments, I say simply – not to me.  Indeed, he
has not expressed one word of remorse or regret to me, notwithstanding
the fact that he has had many clear opportunities to do just that if he was so
inclined.  Accordingly, I reject these specific suggestions that the accused is
remorseful for his actions – I find that he is not.  Nonetheless, as I
have already expressly indicated, this absence of remorse by the accused must
not be perceived as an aggravating factor on the issue of sentence, but rather
may only be properly seen as the absence of a mitigating factor.
[32]          According
to s. 718 of the Criminal Code, the “fundamental purpose” of sentencing
is to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,
peaceful and safe society” by imposing “just sanctions” that have one or more
of the following objectives, namely: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct; (b) to
deter the offender and others from committing offences; (c) to separate
offenders from society where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating
offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or the
community; and (f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.
[33]          According
to s. 718.1 of the Code, the “fundamental principle” of sentencing is
that a sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the
degree of responsibility of the offender.”
[34]          Section
718.2 of the Code also dictates that, in imposing sentence, the court
must also take into account a number of principles including the following:
[35]          In all of
the circumstances of this case, in my view the firearms offences committed by
the accused now require the imposition of a global three-year penitentiary term
of imprisonment.
[36]          The former
statutory three-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for offences
contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code was, of course, held to be
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada.  See: R. v. Nur, 2015
SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773; R. v. Charles, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R.
773.
[37]          I reach my
sentencing conclusion regarding the firearms offences committed by the accused
only because I consider a global three-year prison term to be a fit and appropriate
sentence in all of the individual circumstances of this case, and because it is
supported by the applicable judicial authorities.  See, for example: R. v.
Harutyunyan, 2012 ONSC 58, [2012] O.J. No. 177, at paras. 4, 9-20,
affirmed, 2012 ONCA 637, [2012] O.J. No. 4417; R. v. Peterkin, 2013 ONSC
2116, [2013] O.J. No. 1614, at paras. 7, 10, 21-26, affirmed, 2015 ONCA 8, 319
C.C.C. (3d) 191; R. v. Scarlett, 2013 ONSC 562, [2013] O.J. No. 644, at
paras. 3, 7, 13-14, 49-50; R. v. Brown, 2014 ONSC 4217, [2014] O.J. No. 3370, at paras. 19-27; R. v. Mansingh,
2016 ONSC 94, [2016] O.J. No. 92, at paras. 40-45, 47; R. v. McKenzie,

2018 ONSC 1050, [2018] O.J. No. 1003, at paras. 15-24; R. v. Morris,
2021 ONCA 680. 159 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras. 67-81, 96-101, 149-153, 177-180.
[38]          Courts
have repeatedly observed that the criminal possession of handguns remains an
all too prevalent threat to the people of Toronto, and to others living in the
Greater Toronto Area.  Such firearms are frequently employed in connection with
other kinds of serious criminal activity, such as drug-trafficking, and their
possession and use, on occasion, tragically results in serious bodily harm or
death.  The unlawful possession of firearms remains a menace to society. 
Indeed, it has been judicially described as a “cancer in Toronto” and a “plague”
and a “blight on the city and its residents.”  See: R. v. Thavakularatnam,
2018 ONSC 2380, [2018] O.J. No. 2038, at paras. 21-26; R. v. Mohiadin,
2020 ONSC 47; [2020] O.J. No. 93, at paras. 30-31, 41-42.
[39]          To properly
confront and combat this serious social problem, these offences must be met
with exemplary custodial sentences that proportionally reflect the sheer
gravity of the crimes, and which appropriately stress the need to denounce and
deter such crimes.  In the absence of such sentences, these offences and their potentially
disastrous consequences will only continue.  The law-abiding public simply must
be adequately protected.  This can only be accomplished by the imposition of sentences
that ensure that potential offenders know that their illegal possession of
handguns, over-capacity magazines and ammunition, will almost invariably be
accompanied by serious penal consequences.  See: R. v. Danvers (2005),
2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490, 201 O.A.C. 238 (C.A.), at paras. 77-78; R. v. Brown,
2010 ONCA 745, 277 O.A.C. 233, at para. 14; R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206,

R. v. Chambers, 2012 ONSC 817, [2012] O.J. No. 462, at paras. 15-17, affirmed,
2013 ONCA 680, 311 O.A.C. 307; R. v. Mark, 2018 ONSC 447, at para. 24; R.
v. St. Clair, 2018 ONSC 7028, at paras. 47-50; R. v. McNichols, 2020
ONSC 6499, at paras. 37-41.
[40]          I note in
passing the obvious reality that the firearms offences in the present case were
no mere “regulatory” matters, where an otherwise responsible and law-abiding
gun owner inadvertently failed to obtain a proper license or registration, or
possessed a firearm in a location not within the geographic scope of his or her
permit.  Rather, the accused was clearly engaged in true criminal activity.  He
somehow obtained a handgun, an over-capacity magazine, and bullets.  He clearly
knew it was dangerous to have these items in his possession and that it was a
crime for him to have this contraband.  Otherwise, he would not have kept these
dangerous items in his unique lockbox that looked like a book – and immediately
tried to distance himself from them when he feared that the police might arrive
at his home to investigate.  His unlawful possession of this firearm, its
over-capacity magazine and ammunition, were very serious criminal offences,
which created a significant public safety risk, and which merit the imposition
of at least a three-year term of imprisonment.  See: R. v. Nur, 2011
ONSC 4874, 275 C.C.C. (3d) 330, at paras. 41-45, 49-52, 70,
145-149, affirmed, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at paras. 4, 6,
51-53, 107-109, 144, 206, affirmed, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at paras.
5, 82, 120; R. v. Smickle, 2014 ONCA 49, 306 C.C.C. (3d) 351, at para. 19.
[41]          Accordingly,
the proper application of the applicable principles of sentencing, in all of
the circumstances of this case, must result in at least a three-year global penitentiary
term of imprisonment for the accused in relation to these firearms offences.  As
McLachlin C.J.C. stated, in delivering the judgment of the majority of the
Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Nur, at para. 82:
[42]          I must reject
the submission of defence counsel that the accused should receive a conditional
sentence, under s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code.  As I have already
indicated, in my view, the sheer gravity of these firearm offences, and the important
governing sentencing principles of denunciation and deterrence, require the
imposition of a three-year global term of penitentiary imprisonment.  The
duration of that sentence renders the accused legally ineligible for a
conditional sentence.  However, I must say that I would not have imposed
a “conditional sentence” on this accused, even if I had concluded that he was
otherwise eligible for such a sentence.  The accused has a relatively recent
criminal record (i.e., convictions in 2019 and 2022), he has already had the recent
benefit of a conditional sentence (i.e., in 2022), and yet he committed the
present firearms offences in the home where he lived with his family.  In the
result, I would not sentence him to a period of theoretical
“imprisonment” in his own residence (where he committed these very offences) –
for any period of time (whether that home now be in Toronto, Montreal, or
somewhere else).
[43]          The
rehabilitation of the accused remains, of course, a key consideration in the
sentencing process.  The accused must realize, as part of that rehabilitation,
that he simply cannot continue to commit criminal offences – otherwise he will
be sentenced to increasingly lengthy periods of imprisonment.  He must also
realize that he, most certainly, must not commit further firearms offences.  The
accused would not tell me why he possessed a handgun, an over-capacity magazine
and ammunition for that firearm.  But, I will clearly tell him, right now, that
if he continues to commit firearm offences in the future, he will inevitably be
sentenced to a longer term of penitentiary imprisonment.  Of course, the
accused can engage in various educational and social programs while he is
imprisoned, he and can work on his rehabilitation there – while the community
is being properly protected from the commission of such inherently dangerous
offences.
[44]          The
three-year global term of penitentiary imprisonment that should now be imposed
upon the accused, must be slightly reduced in order to fairly provide the
accused with the credit he deserves for his brief period of pre-sentence
detention.
[45]          More
particularly, I understand that, following his arrest for these offences, the
accused was in custody between July 2 and 9, 2021.  Giving the accused the appropriate
enhanced statutory credit of 1.5 days imprisonment for each day of pre-sentence
custody, as required by s. 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code, means that the
accused must be credited with having already served a sentence approaching two
weeks.  See R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, at paras.
7, 34, 68-80, affirming, 2013 ONCA 147, 114 O.R. (3d) 641.  Accordingly, the
sentence now imposed upon the accused must be reduced by approximately two
weeks.
[46]          In addition,
in my view, as counsel have jointly suggested, all of the following ancillary
sentencing orders are appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
[47]          First,
pursuant to ss. 109(1)(b) and 109(2) of the Criminal Code, I order that
the accused be prohibited: (1) from the possession of any prohibited firearm,
restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, and prohibited
ammunition for life: and (2) from the possession of any firearm (other than a
restricted or prohibited firearm), cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition,
and explosive substance for a period of ten years after the date the accused is
released from the term of imprisonment for these offences.
[48]          Second, as
the accused has been found guilty of at least one “secondary designated
offence,” pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code, I order the
taking of bodily substances from the accused for forensic DNA analysis.  In
this regard, I am satisfied that, having regard to all of the circumstances of
this case, including the gravity of the offences committed by the accused, his
criminal record, and the minimal impact the order will have on the privacy and
security interests of the accused, that the order should be made.  Such an
order is, in my view, in the best interests of the administration of justice.
[49]          Third,
pursuant to s. 490.1(1) of the Criminal Code, I order that the “offence-related
property” in this case, namely, the firearm, the over-capacity magazine, and the
ammunition that has been seized and detained in this case, be forfeited to His Majesty
in right of Ontario and thereafter disposed of as directed by the Attorney
General.
[50]          In
summary, the accused is now sentenced to concurrent terms of
penitentiary imprisonment of three-years, less two-weeks, in duration in relation
to each of the three “possession” offences of which the accused has been
convicted, namely: (1) the unlawful possession of a restricted firearm, namely
a handgun, together with readily accessible ammunition, contrary to s. 95(1) of
the Criminal Code; (2) the unlawful possession of a restricted handgun,
while knowingly not being the holder of the requisite license or registration
certificate, contrary to s. 92(1) of the Criminal Code; and (3) the
unlawful possession of a prohibited magazine, while knowingly not the holder of
the requisite license, contrary to s. 92(2) of the Criminal Code.
[51]          When added
to his credit for his pre-sentence custody, this effectively results in the
imposition of a total global penitentiary sentence of three years imprisonment. 
The accused is, of course, also subject to all of the aforementioned ancillary
sentencing orders.
