Ms. Teeple applied for dependant relief under
the Succession Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26 (the “SLRA”) against
the estate of Stephen Thomsen. Mr. Thomsen died on August 13, 2021, after
having executed two wills in 2019.
[2]              
The Primary Will contained various specific
bequests and left the residue of the estate governed by that will to his five
grandchildren. The Secondary Will dealt exclusively with Mr. Thomsen’s shares
in a welding business, which he left to his two adult children living in
Canada. The value of the property governed by each will is significant.
[3]              
Ms. Teeple’s claim was settled at a mediation for
the all-inclusive sum of $225,000, with the only remaining issue being the
extent to which the settlement would be funded from the primary and secondary
estates.
[4]              
The Office of the Children's Lawyer (“the OCL”) moved
for approval of the settlement under r. 7.08 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, on behalf of the grandchildren under the age of 16 and,
if approved, for an order that the settlement be funded rateably by the beneficiaries
under each will. At the conclusion of the motion, I approved the settlement,
but ordered that it be funded rateably only by the legatees of the primary
estate for brief reasons to follow. These are my reasons.
[5]              
With respect to the propriety of the settlement,
I agree with Ms. Stamm that the settlement is a prudent one in light of the
potential that Ms. Teeple might meet the definition of a “spouse” by satisfying
the requirements set out in Molodwich v. Penttinen (1980), 17 R.F.L.
(2d) 376, 1980 CanLII 1537.
[6]              
With respect to the issue of funding, the OCL
relies on s. 68 of the SLRA, which reads:
[7]              
Ms. Stamm submits that it would be unfair if the
entire settlement was funded from the residue of the estate under the Primary
Will. She relies on cases that have held that dependant support claims should prima
facie be borne by the whole of a testator’s estate, rather than the
residuary beneficiaries: Re Nalywayko (1984), 17 E.T.R. 151 (Ont. Surr.
Ct.); Quinn v. Carrigan, 2014 ONSC 5682.
[8]              
While I agree that the settlement should be
funded rateably among the beneficiaries, I do not agree that it should be
funded by the beneficiaries under the Secondary Will. As Ms. Stamm candidly
sets out in her factum, where it is possible, a court determining the
issue of funding dependant relief should have regard to what a reasonable
testator would do in the circumstances of the case: Randle v Randle Estate
(1976), 71 D.L.R. (3d) 208, 1976 ALTASCAD 123 Alta. S.C. App. Div.), at para
27. In the circumstances of this case, I believe a reasonable testator would
have done what it appears Mr. Thomsen would have done, which is to provide for
payment out of the primary estate.
[9]              
The evidence reveals that Mr. Thomsen had four
Primary Wills prepared between 2013 and 2021. In 2013, Mr. Thomsen signed a
Primary Will in which he left Ms. Teeple the sum of $50,000 and a property on
Sparks Steet, in North Bay. The property was eventually transferred to Ms.
Teeple during Mr. Thomsen’s lifetime.
[10]          
In 2017 and 2019, Mr. Thomsen had Primary Wills
prepared in which he left nothing to Ms. Teeple. However, at the end of his
life, Mr. Thomsen called his lawyer and had him draft another Primary Will, in
which he left $500,000 to Ms. Teeple. That will was not signed by Mr. Thomsen
before he died. Nonetheless, in every estate plan he made between 2013 and 2021,
Mr. Thomsen dealt with the shares of his company outside of the Primary Will.
In the two estate plans in which he left money to Ms. Teeple, Mr. Thomsen
intended to have the money pass under the Primary Will, and to have the shares
of his company pass separately from the rest of his estate, unaffected by the
bequests made in the Primary Will.
[11]          
I consider Mr. Thomsen’s estate plan to have
been that of a reasonable testator. It is a common occurrence to see a testator
use a Secondary Will to transfer the shares of a closely-held corporation
separately from the bequests made to beneficiaries in a Primary Will. That was
clearly his intention here and I do not believe it would be appropriate to
deviate from that reasonable intention.
[12]          
For these reasons, I have ordered that:
