[1]              
On July 12, 2023, Mr. Ahmed pleaded guilty to three counts of trafficking
in fentanyl - a Schedule I controlled substance - contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19.
[2]              
An Enhanced Presentence Report (“EPSR”) was ordered to provide
information about the impact anti-Black racism may have had on Mr. Ahmed and
how it may be connected to the circumstances in which he now finds himself (the
“Morris” report). Since the time of his guilty plea, there have been numerous adjournments
while awaiting the Morris report. The report was completed on August 27, 2024, at
which time a hearing date was scheduled.
[3]              
In pleading guilty, Mr. Ahmed admitted that on three separate dates, he
sold fentanyl to an undercover officer. Specifically:
[4]              
On all three occasions, the fentanyl was mixed with etizolam and
caffeine. Etizolam is a Schedule IV substance. At the time of his arrest, the
police searched Mr. Ahmed’s vehicle and found a further 2.24 grams of fentanyl.
It too was mixed with etizolam and caffeine. The police also seized $205.00
cash, a digital scale, and an iPhone. While executing a search warrant at Mr. Ahmed’s
residence, the police seized $410.00.
[5]              
In total, 10.77 grams of fentanyl was trafficked. A further 2.24 grams was
available for trafficking. Each of the transactions was arranged by an undercover
officer calling a number supplied by a confidential informant and arranging to
purchase fentanyl. On each occasion, Mr. Ahmed arrived alone at the scheduled meeting
place and completed the sale.
[6]              
Mr. Ahmed was born on August 17, 1990, in Washington.  At the time of
the offence, he was 30 years old. He is now 34 years old. He has no prior
criminal record. He moved to Canada as a child and is a Canadian citizen. He
grew up in Toronto.
[7]              
Mr. Ahmed has been on bail since his arrest without incident. His mother
is his named surety. For the first 5 months, Mr. Ahmed was subject to a curfew
of 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. except when in the presence of his surety. After he
obtained employment as a truck driver, his bail terms were varied to allow for
travel for work purposes. The curfew was in effect until July 24, 2023, when it
was removed due to Mr. Ahmed’s demonstrated compliance.
[8]              
In deciding the appropriate sentence for Mr. Ahmed, I have been assisted
greatly by the thorough and insightful Morris report prepared by social worker
Michelle Richards.
[9]              
The EPSR indicates the following:
[10]          
In preparation of the EPSR, Ms. Richards met with Mr. Ahmed on three
dates and also conducted collateral interviews of Mr. Ahmed’s brother – Kamil
Mohamed – and mother, Ubah Farah. In terms of her assessment, Ms. Richards wrote
that Mr. Ahmed enjoys the support of his family, including his ex-wife who
describes Mr. Ahmed as an excellent father. The offences are said to have
occurred during a brief three-week period about one year into the COVID
pandemic when Mr. Ahmed was unemployed, on limited income, and at a low point
in his life. Otherwise, aside from his alcohol abuse, he has a “consistent work
history” and strong work ethic as reflected by his decision to pursue work in
Alberta. Ms. Richards noted that Mr. Ahmed “was subjected to involuntary
interactions with police when he was a child and youth, and experienced use of
force on various occasions”. Ms. Richards found Mr. Ahmed’s description of
these events to be “consistent with racial profiling”.
[11]          
Mr. Ahmed has also filed numerous letters of support from his mother,
father, younger brother, former spouse, and friends who have known him for many
years. He also filed letters from two representatives of community
organizations, namely: (i) Abdi Dayr – a case worker with Midaynta Community Services;
and (ii) Ainan Salim Dahmis, a mental health case worker with the Somali
Immigrant Aid Organization. A common theme in all letters is that the offences
before the court are out of character for Mr. Ahmed. Mr. Ahmed is regarded as a
valuable mentor, family member, a loving and supportive father, and someone who
has a strong work ethic and is committed to the broader community. The letters
all describe Mr. Ahmed as having much greater potential than the poor choices
he made that resulted in his arrest. Aside from the letters, the support of Mr.
Ahmed’s family was evidenced by their attendance in court for the sentencing
proceedings.
[12]          
The letters from the two community members demonstrate that after his
arrest, Mr. Ahmed has taken positive steps. He participated in counselling
services offered through the “Project Turn Around” initiative at Midaynta
Community Services. More recently, he has volunteered at the Somali Immigrant
Aid Organization, participating in mental health workshops.
[13]          
Counsel for the Crown seeks a three year sentence of imprisonment
concurrent on each charge. The Crown also seeks an order pursuant to s. 109 of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 for 10 years, a DNA order, and a
forfeiture order.
[14]          
In support of this position, the Crown relied on the following cases: R.
v. Broderick, 2020 ONSC 7434; R. v.
Campbell, 2022 ONCA 666; R. v. DiPasquale, 2023 ONSC 758; R. v.
Doxtator, 2019 ONCJ 26; R. v. Jackson, 2024 ONSC 2402; R. v.
Lawal, 2024 ONSC 3621; R. v. McMahon, 2022 ONCA 459; R. v.
Mohamud, 2024 ONSC 5009; R v. Mirza, (Unreported – judgment released
May 30, 2024 – by Justice Applegate of the Ontario Court of Justice); R. v
Ryn, 2023 ONSC 2919; R. v. Willis, 2019 ONSC 7324; and, R. v.
Young, 2020 ONSC 1394.
[15]          
Mr. Ahmed takes no issue with the ancillary orders sought by the Crown.
However, Mr. Ahmed urges the court to impose a two-year conditional sentence and
relies on the following cases in support of this position: R. v. Stewart,
2024 ONSC 281; R. v. Hugh, 2023 ONSC 6135; R. v. Collins, 2023
ONSC 5768; R. v. Williams, 2023 ONCJ 259; R. v. Gordon, 2023 ONCJ
157; R. v. Russell, 2023 ONCJ 133; R. v. Anishnambie, 2022 ONCJ
319; and, R. v. Grant, 2021 ONCJ 507. Defence counsel recognizes that
the sentence sought by the Crown is within the range, but argues that given the
mitigating factors in this case, a conditional sentence can sufficiently
address all of the applicable principles.
[16]          
A consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors is mandated by
s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code.
[17]          
There are many mitigating factors in this case:
[18]          
The aggravating factors in this case are the gravity of the offence, the
quantity of fentanyl trafficked (10.77 grams), and the repeated nature of Mr.
Ahmed’s conduct. The Agreed Facts speak to a “dial-a-dope” operation. It was
not a one-off incident. It was profit motivated. On arrest, Mr. Ahmed possessed
the tools of his trade, including a digital scale. Like millions of other
Canadians during the COVID pandemic, Mr. Ahmed struggled financially and psychologically.
As Mr. Ahmed acknowledges, this is no excuse.
[19]          
The parties also agree that Mr. Ahmed should be given some credit in
accordance with the principles set out in R. v. Downes, 79 O.R. (3d) 321,
2006 CanLII 3957 (C.A.). This is in recognition of the fact that Mr. Ahmed was subject
to strict bail conditions, including a curfew, for a lengthy period of time
without incident. Further, the parties agree that Mr. Ahmed is entitled to
three days of credit for the time spent in custody, as set out in s. 719(3.1)
of the Criminal Code and the principles in R. v. Summers, 2013
ONCA 147, 114 O.R. (3d) 641, aff’d 2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575.
[20]          
The fundamental purpose of sentencing, as set out in s. 718 of the Criminal
Code, is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention
initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and
safe society. This purpose is furthered by imposing sanctions that have one or
more of the following objectives:
[21]          
The fundamental principle of proportionality requires that all sentences
be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
of the offender: s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code; R. v. Lacasse,
2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 53.
[22]          
Section s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code further directs sentencing
courts to consider a number of other statutory principles, including: the need to
increase or reduce the sentence to account for any mitigating or aggravating circumstances
relating to the offence or the offender; the need for parity; and the need for
restraint when imposing imprisonment. A sentencing court must consider all
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances.
[23]          
The gravity of the offence and Mr. Ahmed’s degree of responsibility are
significant. The offence of trafficking in a Schedule I substance is punishable
by a maximum of life imprisonment: s. 5(3), Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act. While Mr. Ahmed’s offences have no specific identified complainant, it
would be wrong to view them as victimless. Trafficking in a deadly drug such as
fentanyl causes immeasurable harm to the community. As noted by the Court of
Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Loor, 2017 ONCA 696, at para. 33, “every day
in our communities, fentanyl abuse claims the lives of Canadians.” Indeed, given
its deadly and addictive properties, fentanyl has been described as “public
enemy number one”: R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, [2021] 3 S.C.R. 366, at
para. 93; R. v. Mengesha, 2022 ONCA 654, 516 C.R.R. (2d) 31, at
para. 16; R. v. Campbell, 2022 ONCA 666, 163 O.R. (3d) 355, at para. 83.
[24]          
In the recent decision of R. v. Campbell, 2024 SCC 42, the
Supreme Court of Canada highlighted the grave risk that fentanyl poses to
public safety. As stated by Jamal J., for a majority of the Court, at para. 132:
[25]          
The fact that less than two milligrams can be fatal puts in context the
gravity of Mr. Ahmed’s trafficking of 10.77 grams. Mr. Ahmed’s claimed lack of
knowledge of the dangers of fentanyl does not diminish the gravity of the
offence or the degree of his responsibility. At best, he was wilfully blind to
the nature of the illicit drugs he was trafficking: Campbell (ONCA), at
paras. 96-100.
[26]          
Given the gravity of the offence, even first offenders can expect a
penitentiary sentence: Loor, at para. 50. In this case, Mr. Ahmed
engaged in repeated sales of increasing amounts; the last transaction involving
more than three times the quantity trafficked in the first. His conduct was driven
by greed, not addiction. Evidence of systemic anti-Black racism and its impact
on the particular offender does not mitigate the seriousness of an offence.
However, it may reduce an offender’s moral culpability for the offence: Morris,
at paras. 75-81, 87-101. It may also inform how a sentencing judge balances the
various sentencing principles in the particular case.
[27]          
In this case, while Mr. Ahmed has experienced anti-Black racism, his
offending conduct was motivated by greed. However, the social context evidence,
as detailed in the EPSR, establishes a number of risk factors for offending in
Mr. Ahmed’s life linked to systemic discrimination. He grew up in poverty. He witnessed
and experienced systemic anti-Black racism. Further, I am mindful that, as
noted by the author of the EPSR (p. 9), a jail sentence may have a
disproportionate impact on Mr. Ahmed. See: Morris, at paras. 76-101; R.
v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, 85 C.R. (7th) 221, at para. 135. This does not excuse
his conduct. It does, however, provide a lens through which his offending
conduct is viewed.
[28]          
 In fashioning an appropriate sentence, I have also considered the
principle of parity. Parity requires that similar offenders who commit similar
offences in similar circumstances should receive similar sentences: s. 718.2(b),
Criminal Code; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424,
at para. 31.
[29]          
While assessing proportionality and parity, I have considered all of the
cases filed by the parties. The range of sentence reflected in these cases
demonstrate the highly individualized process of sentencing. One that takes into
account the purposes and principles of sentencing, as well as the aggravating
and mitigating factors in each case.
[30]          
In the circumstances of this case, I agree with the Crown that three
years is at the lower end of the appropriate range. As observed by Nakatsuru
J., in R. v. Lawal, 2024 ONSC 3621, at para. 27, a penitentiary sentence
is required even with mitigating factors. While counsel for Mr. Ahmed has cited
cases in which a conditional sentence was imposed, I find that all are distinguishable.
None involved trafficking in fentanyl, only possession, or possession
for the purpose of trafficking. Nor did any involve three separate incidents.
[31]          
Mr. Ahmed, I accept that you have strong rehabilitative prospects. Your
letters of support and the insightful letter you read to the court on the last
occasion show that you have much to offer to your family and community. I
accept your statement as a genuine expression of remorse. I commend you on all
of the efforts you have made. You are a first offender. By pleading guilty you
have accepted responsibility. I have considered these, along with the many
other mitigating factors.
[32]          
I am also mindful of the collateral consequences of these convictions. You
lost your  employment as a truck driver due to the challenges in crossing the
border. Further, I am mindful that the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the
recent decision of R. v. Habib, 2024 ONCA 830, at paras.  41-47,
provided guidance on assessing the relevance of family separation consequences.
While these consequences cannot justify imposing a disproportionate sentence,
sentencing judges must strive to “preserve the family as much as possible”. In
other words, family separation consequences must be considered when: (i)
determining the length of the prison term; and (ii) determining whether
incarceration is required at all: Habib, para. 44. As noted by Tulloch,
C.J., in Habib at para. 45, “family separation consequences may justify
a sentence adjustment – even a significant one – or a departure from the range”
even for “grave offences that require deterrence and denunciation”.
[33]          
While Mr. Ahmed is responsible for the harm he has caused his family,
and the consequences they may suffer as a result of the court’s sentence, his
family members are “innocent” and I am required to prevent and mitigate the
adverse consequences on them “as much as possible”: Habib, at para.
46.
[34]          
As you acknowledge in your letter, “ignorance is no excuse”. It is purely
good fortune that no one was killed by the actions that bring you before the
court. Minimal amounts of fentanyl can, and do cause death. Because of these
dire risks and the prevalence of fentanyl in our society, the sentences meted
out by courts are lengthy, even for simple possession. The sentences
communicate a strong message of denunciation and general deterrence in an attempt
to rid our society of this insidious drug. I find that the fact that you
trafficked this deadly drug, not just once, but on three occasions, makes a
sentence of less than two years unfit. A reformatory sentence is simply not
appropriate given all of the circumstances of this offence. In fact, were it
not for the many mitigating factors in this case, a sentence of five years
would be entirely appropriate.
[35]          
Since this is your first penitentiary sentence, restraint is required. The
principle of restraint requires the imposition of the least intrusive sentence
and the shortest duration necessary to achieve a just, fit and proportionate
sentence: see R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras.
95-96; R. v. Borde (2003), 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 36. In my
view, the shortest duration necessary to achieve a just, fit and proportionate
sentence is 30 months of imprisonment. This sentence reflects consideration for
the credit required in accordance with the principles set out in Duncan
and Summers.
[36]          
I know that you, your family, and your supporters will not agree with this
sentence and will regard it as unduly harsh. While it may offer little comfort,
I do hope that this sentence will not end your commitment to turn your life
around.
[37]          
Mr. Ahmed will be sentenced to 30 months in jail concurrent on each
charge.
[38]          
The items seized by the police will be the subject of a forfeiture order.
[39]          
Pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code, you are required
to provide samples of bodily substances as reasonably required for purposes of
forensic DNA analysis.
[40]          
Finally, pursuant to s. 109(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, you will
be prohibited from possessing any weapons for ten years.
