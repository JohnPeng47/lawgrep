    "summary": "The named plaintiffs have sought to amend their statement of claim to add Edward Ouellette as a defendant and substitute Stephanie Ouellette as the child plaintiff's litigation guardian. The court expressed no inherent objection to these changes but found the amendment problematic where it allowed Mr. Ouellette to remain a plaintiff while also being a defendant due to his own negligence. The court cited precedent disallowing a person from suing themselves for negligence. The proposed amended pleading is deemed impermissible, and Mr. Ouellette should be removed as a plaintiff. The motion was adjourned to January 17, 2025, to allow for further consideration and input from involved parties."
