    "summary": "The court dismissed the plaintiffs' action, set aside the guarantee, mortgage, and promissory note, and ordered that the mortgage be removed from the title to the parents' property due to a lack of understanding of the documents by the defendants, misrepresentation by their son, undue influence, and insufficient independent legal advice. The claim against the defendants Ashok and Usha Badhwar stemmed from a guarantee, promissory note, and mortgage they signed to secure their son Rochak’s debt, which they did not fully understand. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to meet their legal obligations to ensure Ashok and Usha understood the risks and implications involved."
