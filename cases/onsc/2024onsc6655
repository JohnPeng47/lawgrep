By way of endorsement dated November 13, 2024, I granted the defendants’
motion for an order transferring this action from Milton (Central West Region)
to the Toronto Region. The plaintiffs opposed the motion.

A successful party is entitled to costs in the absence of a very good
reason(s) not to award them: Schreiber v. Mulroney, 2007 CanLII 31754
(ON SCO, [2007) O.J. No. 3191 (Sup Ct.) at para. 2.

I have considered the submissions of counsel and the factors enumerated
under rule 57 as well as the principle of proportionality.
[4]              
Further, I have taken into account the principles set forth by the Court
of Appeal in Boucher v. Public Accountants Counsel for the Province of
Ontario, 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON C.A.), (2004), 71 O.R. (3rd) 291
(C.A.), specifically that the overall objective of fixing costs is to fix an
amount that is fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful party to pay in the
particular circumstances, rather than an amount fixed by actual costs incurred
by the successful litigant.
[5]              
Given the complexity of the matter and the result achieved, I order that
the plaintiffs pay to the defendants partial indemnity costs in the
all-inclusive amount of $2,980.00 within 60 days.
