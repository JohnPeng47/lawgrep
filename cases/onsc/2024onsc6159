While the jury deliberated, the defendant brought
what is typically referred to as a threshold motion. He seeks a declaration
that the plaintiff's claims for healthcare expenses and non-pecuniary losses
are barred pursuant to s. 267.5 of the Insurance Act.[1] The defendant argues that
the plaintiff has failed to prove she sustained a permanent, serious impairment
of an important physical, mental, or psychological function as a result of the
collision.
[2]              
This personal injury action arises from a motorcycle
/ car accident that occurred in Ottawa, Ontario, on October 8, 2017. The
plaintiff, Lisa Davis, was riding her motorcycle on Prince of Wales Drive. The
defendant was stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Prince of Wales
Drive and Barnesdale Road. Despite testifying that he looked both ways, the
defendant entered the intersection, and obstructed Ms. Davis' path. Ms. Davis
attempted to brake but collided with the defendant's car. She was ejected her
from her motorcycle at a speed of 40 to 60 kilometers per hour and sustained a mild
traumatic brain injury. The defendant admitted liability but argued that the
plaintiff was contributorily negligent. The main issue at trial were damages.
[3]              
Shortly after this motion was argued, the jury concluded
that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent, and assessed the
plaintiff’s damages as follows:
[4]              
The only issue on this motion is whether the
plaintiff has sustained a permanent, serious impairment of an important
physical, mental, or psychological function as a result of the collision. If
so, she would fall within the statutory exception to the general immunity from
action provided under s. 267.5 of the Act.
[5]              
The relevant statutory and
regulatory provisions for determining the threshold are contained in sections
267.5 of the Act and sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of O. Reg. 461/96 as amended by O. Reg. 381/03 (the “Regulations”).
[6]              
The Act provides that the owner of an automobile, the
occupants of an automobile, and any person present at the incident, are not
liable in an action for non-pecuniary loss unless the injured person has
sustained a “permanent, serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or
psychological function.”
[7]             
Subsections 267.5(3) and 267.5(5)
provide as follows:
[8]              
Effective October 1, 2003,
O. Reg. 381/03, amended Court Proceedings for Automobile
Accidents that Occur on or After November 1, 1996, O. Reg. 461/96 O.
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Reg. 461/96, helps to clarify the meaning of the threshold wording in s. 267.5(5) (b) of the Act. In addition, section 4.3 stipulates the evidence which must be adduced to
prove permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or
psychological function.  Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of O. Reg. 461/96 provide as follows:
[9]         
A judge is not bound by the
jury's verdict when making a threshold determination. The verdict is, however,
one factor the judge may consider. [2]
[10]          
At the time of the accident, Ms. Davis was 48
years old; she is now 55. Raised in Peterborough, she returned to Ottawa after
high school. She completed one year of marketing at Algonquin College before
beginning a career as a server, which she continued throughout her working life.
[11]          
Ms. Davis described her pre-collision life as
happy and great.
[12]          
Ms. Davis excelled in her job and took great
pleasure in her interactions with regular clients. In 2005, she worked for one
year at Vittoria Trattoria, an Italian restaurant, where the owner, Stacey
Santaguida, attested to Ms. Davis's excellence as a hardworking server who was
well appreciated by customers. At the time of the accident, she was employed at
the Heart and Crown pub, where she achieved remarkable success, winning trips
to Mexico for top sales of Corona beer for four consecutive years. Her
colleague, Angie Turgeon, noted that regular customers would frequently order
Corona to support Ms. Davis in these contests. Ms. Davis herself testified that
she found joy in her job and the lifestyle it provided her.
[13]          
Before the accident, Ms. Davis was in good
health, rarely visiting her family doctor. In 2016, she reported memory
concerns and headaches to her family doctor Manorie Edirisinghe, who
recommended supplements and administered a cognitive test. Ms. Davis scored
perfectly on this test.
[14]          
Ms. Davis led an extremely
active lifestyle before the accident, both physically and socially. While
working full-time, she:
[15]          
Ms. Davis frequently engaged in activities with
her brothers. John testified they would cross-country ski together for 1-1.5
hours every weekend when conditions allowed. They also went on camping trips,
portaging with 40-50 lb backpacks. Craig stated he would see Ms. Davis twice
weekly for bike rides or rollerblading.
[16]          
Ms. Davis was also socially active. Her brothers
described her as upbeat, energetic, adventurous, outgoing, and kind. Long-time
friends Kevin Gottgetreu and Leanne Bazinet characterized her as well-spirited,
bubbly, and with a good sense of humour. They frequently socialized with Ms.
Davis, including:
[17]          
Ms. Davis presented physician evidence in
accordance with s.4.3(2) of the Regulations.
[18]          
Dr. Sara Mitchell, neurologist, assessed Ms.
Davis and testified at trial. Her diagnoses included:
[19]          
Dr. Mitchell found that post-accident, Ms. Davis
experienced symptoms consistent with post-concussion syndrome, including
dizziness, headaches, confusion, and sleep changes. These symptoms persisted to
her March 23, 2021 assessment, significantly impacting Ms. Davis's daily function.
A cognitive test yielded a score of 22/30 (26 is considered normal). Dr.
Mitchell concluded that accident-related impairments interfered with Ms.
Davis's ability to work as a server, complete housekeeping tasks, and engage in
normal social and recreational activities.
[20]          
Dr. Hastings, physiatrist, assessed Ms. Davis on
July 26, 2022. His diagnoses included:
[21]          
Dr. Hastings noted ongoing neck pain since the accident,
with little prospect for substantial improvement given the elapsed time. He
concluded that accident-related cognitive impairments affected Ms. Davis's
memory, work performance, social and recreational activities, and higher-level
housekeeping.
[22]          
Dr. Dale Robinson, neurologist, assessed Ms.
Davis for the defendant. He diagnosed:
[23]          
Dr. Robinson's administered a cognitive test which
yielded a score of 21/30. However, he believed Ms. Davis' impairments were not
neurologically accident-related, explaining that mild traumatic brain injury
symptoms typically resolve within weeks or months.
[24]          
Dr. Muhlstock,
physiatrist, assessed Ms. Davis for the defendant. His diagnoses included:
[25]          
Dr. Muhlstock opined that
any soft tissue injuries typically last for six weeks and had healed/resolved
physiologically given the time elapsed since the accident. He detected no
objective findings of ongoing accident-related impairments.  He did not focus
on Ms. Davis’ headaches because he is not a “head injury” expert. Dr. Muhlstock
conceded that there is a subset of patients who continue to have symptoms
beyond a six-week period.  He did not dispute that Ms. Davis continued to have
symptoms.
[26]          
In evaluating the medical testimony, the court prefers
the opinions of Drs. Mitchell and Hastings to those of Drs. Robinson and
Muhlstock regarding the lasting impact of Ms. Davis' injuries. While Dr.
Muhlstock suggested that soft tissue injuries resolve within weeks and noted no
objective ongoing impairments, he acknowledged that there is a subset of
patients for whom symptoms can persist, aligning with Dr. Robinson's concession
that post-concussion symptoms are potentially permanent
if they persist two years post-accident. The court is persuaded that Ms.
Davis's symptoms, including headaches, neck pain, and sensitivity to light and
sound, have persisted since the accident and align with a mild traumatic brain
injury diagnosis. Despite her efforts to maintain her employment and adapt her
lifestyle, Ms. Davis has experienced significant challenges and limitations
since the accident.
[27]          
Despite Dr. Robinson's assertions that symptoms
of a mild traumatic brain injury typically resolve within weeks, Ms. Davis's
experiences contradict that timeline.  Ms. Davis struggled to work and engage
in her pre-accident activities to the best of her abilities.  She testified
that she was experiencing difficulties after her return to work, and that her
co-workers Jeff and Angie had to “pick up the slack” by taking some of her
tables. Ms. Davis testified that she did not want to stop coming in to work and
was taking Advil to help her cope with her headaches, but that there were days
where she could not cope.  She switched employment in November 2018 because the
Heart and Crown was too loud and bright.  In 2018, she did not rollerblade at
all.  She testified that she tried to exercise and was angry that she could not
do what she could before the accident.  This evidence supports the conclusion
that her injuries had not healed in 2018.
[28]          
I conclude that her accident-related injuries
have had a lasting impact on her quality of life and ability to engage in
pre-accident activities.
[29]          
Ms. Davis presented evidence of changes in her
functioning as required by s. 4.5(5) of the Regulation. These changes
affect her employment as well as her social and recreational activities.
[30]          
She testified that she continues to experience
headaches and neck pain, poor short term memory, and diminished strength in her
hands compared to before the accident. She reported suffering from poor sleep
and irritability. Despite some improvement from Botox treatments for her
headaches, they still occur 2 to 3 times a week and last up to 24 hours. These
headaches affect her focus and work performance, making social interactions at
work and in daily life more challenging.
[31]          
Regarding her memory issues, Ms. Davis testified
that her short-term memory has deteriorated since the accident, requiring her
to rely heavily on post-it notes for reminders. Her brother Craig corroborated
this, noting her use of notes around the house. She recounted instances of
forgetting her destination and neglecting to turn off the oven. Dr. Moustgaard,
her psychologist, testified that Ms. Davis missed an appointment due to
forgetfulness.  Additionally, Ms. Davis testified that she has mistakenly
attended appointments on incorrect days. Her brother Craig testified that she is
forgetful.
[32]          
Ms. Davis also testified about her struggles
with mood and cognition, including increased frustration and decreased
patience. Her brothers and friends reported changes in her mood, communication
difficulties, and a general decline in her energy and sociability. She expressed feelings of anger and sadness, stemming from her
desire to improve and her inability to do so. Her
brothers John and Craig indicated that she has become moodier, more
short-tempered, and frustrated. John also mentioned that she forgets things and
frequently asks him to accompany her to important meetings.  Her friend Kevin
Gottgetreu and his wife Leanne Bazinet testified that Ms. Davis talks quietly
and slowly and struggles with her thoughts.  They remarked that she is no
longer as happy or outgoing as she once was. Ms. Bazinet testified that Ms.
Davis appears tired and slower than normal, and that having a conversation with
her proves difficult.  She had not noticed any real improvement over time.
[33]          
Ms. Davis has indicated that she now requires
more downtime following any activity. Her brother Craig testified that she
often feels exhausted after work and needs to take naps. Overall, Ms. Davis
exhibits significantly less energy and independence than she did prior to the
accident.
[34]          
Ms. Davis testified that she used to enjoy work
and that she found it challenging and fun.  While she is happy to have a job,
she does not enjoy it like before.  She considered herself lucky to be employed
given her limitations.
[35]          
Ms. Davis testified that her impairments affect
her work in several ways. She is unable to take orders confidently without
writing them down, particularly when dealing with more complex orders or larger
groups. She has difficulty connecting with customers and engaging in social
conversations with her regulars. Although she acknowledges that she can still
work as a server, she does not perform as well or as efficiently as before.
Additionally, the more physically demanding aspects of her job may trigger
headaches.
[36]          
Ms. Stacey Santaguida, Ms. Davis’ current
employer, testified that Ms. Davis works the lunch shift on weekdays, typically
three to five days per week, averaging four days. While Ms. Davis remains a
great server, Ms. Santaguida noted that she has become more irritable and
short-fused compared to before. Other servers have complained that Ms. Davis
can be demanding and snappy. However, her skills with customers still work in
her favor. Ms. Davis occasionally calls in sick or leaves early due to her
headaches.
[37]          
Ms. Davis testified that there has been a
significant change in her ability to engage in social and recreational
activities. While she can still engage in most activities, she does so
differently, less frequently and with less enjoyment than before. Rollerblading
now causes her headaches. Although she can ride a motorcycle, she feels more
nervous and less relaxed than before. She has stopped running and is hesitant
to resume it. Her brother Craig testified that she rollerblades less frequently
and never alone. He also noted a decrease in her endurance during cross-country
skiing. Her brother John added that they ski less frequently and for shorter durations
and mentioned that the last time they went camping was in 2020.
[38]          
Mr. Gottgetreu testified that during a
motorcycle trip with Ms. Davis after her collision, she lacked confidence and
advised him not to wait for her if she lagged behind. Although she receives
invitations to social gatherings, Ms. Davis frequently declines to attend. Ms.
Bazinet noted that her interactions with Ms. Davis have decreased
significantly, and when they do meet, the visits are often shorter due to Ms.
Davis becoming tired and struggling to concentrate, leading her to leave early.
Although invited, Ms. Bazinet mentioned that Ms. Davis did not visit her this
year and only came a few times over the past few years.
[39]          
Ms. Davis testified that prior to the accident,
she maintained a tidy home and performed thorough cleanings every two weeks.
However, she now experiences headaches when vacuuming and requires significant
"downtime" after a day of work. Consequently, she hired a cleaner
beginning in late 2018 or 2019. Currently, her friend and tenant Kelly Gibson,
who is a professional cleaner, handles the cleaning duties in exchange for a
reduction in rent.
[40]          
In Meyer v. Bright, the court
outlined the three-part inquiry which is to be undertaken in the threshold
analysis:
[41]          
The defendant does not dispute that Ms. Davis
sustained impairments of a physical, mental or psychological function.
[42]          
In Brak v. Walsh, the Court of
Appeal clarified that "permanent," in the context of s. 267(5),
refers to an injury that lasts indefinitely into the future, rather than for a
limited period with a definite end. The requirement for a permanent injury is
satisfied when a functional limitation is unlikely to improve for
the indefinite future.[3] 
Similarly, in Sheldon v. Reyna, the court held that
"permanent" does not mean forever, but it does imply that the impairment
persists into the indefinite future, in contrast to an anticipated recovery
with a defined end date.”[4]
[43]          
I accept the evidence presented by Drs. Mitchell
and Hastings indicating that Ms. Davis’ symptoms, which have continued for 7
years following the accident, are unlikely to improve. Although the severity
and frequency of her headaches have been reduced with Botox injections, she
still experiences them 2-3 times per week, with each lasting up to 24 hours.
Additionally, she continues to suffer from memory deficits, concentration
difficulties, neck pain, and reduced strength in her hands. This aligns with
Dr. Robinson’s testimony that post-concussion symptoms have the potential to
become permanent if they persist beyond two years after the accident.
[44]          
The defendant contends that Ms. Davis has
managed to continue working, perform her daily activities, and can complete her
household chores, suggesting that her impairments are neither important nor
serious. He argues that for an impairment to be deemed serious, it must exceed
the threshold of what is tolerable. According to him, Ms. Davis’ residual
discomfort, despite being frustrating or unpleasant, does not rise to the level
of seriousness required to qualify as a significant impairment.[5]
[45]          
Section 4.2(1) of the Regulations states
that a permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental, or
psychological function must significantly interfere with one of the following:
(1) the person's ability to continue their regular employment; (2) the person's
ability to continue training for a career; or (3) most of their usual daily
activities, taking into account the person’s age. In this case, the relevant
considerations are Ms. Davis's employment and her activities of daily living.
[46]          
Regarding the ability to continue one’s employment,
paragraph 4.2(1) 2. of the Regulations stipulates that the impaired
function must be necessary for performing the essential tasks of the person’s
regular or usual employment. This assessment considers any reasonable efforts
made to accommodate the impairment, as well as the person’s reasonable efforts
to utilize such accommodations. Regarding her employment, I agree with the
defendant that Ms. Davis has not sufficiently demonstrated that she meets the
necessary criteria for a serious impairment to an important physical, mental or
psychological function.
[47]          
Section 4.2 of the Regulations provide
that the function that is impaired must be necessary to perform the activities
that are essential tasks of the person’s regular employment.   Ms. Davis has continued
to work in her regular position since the accident, benefiting from
accommodations. These include permitting her to leave early when she
experiences headaches and having fellow servers cover her tables when she
struggles.
[48]          
The Regulations establish a less
stringent standard for assessing the importance of a function in relation to
activities of daily living. For a function to be deemed important in the
context of essential employment tasks or essential career training tasks, it
must be necessary for performing those tasks. However, when it comes to
activities of daily living, the threshold is lower; the impaired function need
only be important to those activities. [6]
[49]          
Activities of daily are wide-ranging and
go beyond household and employment activities to include the ability to
socialize with others, have intimate relations and enjoy one’s family and
recreational activities.[7]
[50]          
In Meyer v. Bright, the Court of
Appeal held that the use of the word “important” is intended to distinguish
between those bodily functions which are important to the injured person and
those which are not.  Toscano Roccamo J. emphasized that the evaluation of what
constitutes an important function is inherently subjective, as there are bodily
functions important to some but not others.[8]
[51]          
The Legislature clearly intended for injured
individuals to endure some level of interference with their enjoyment of life
without qualifying for compensation, establishing that only a
"serious" impairment will suffice. Symptoms that are tolerable and
still enable a claimant to function effectively do not meet this threshold.
Conversely, symptoms that exceed tolerable limits and significantly impair a
plaintiff's enjoyment of life will be considered sufficiently serious. Courts
must evaluate the totality of evidence, whether medical or testimonial, to
determine whether the interference with the plaintiff's life is substantial. A
person who can perform daily activities but suffers from permanent
symptoms—such as sleep disorders, headaches, dizziness, and nausea—that
significantly impact their enjoyment of life should be recognized as having
sustained a serious impairment.[9]
[52]          
The defendant argues that the plaintiff has
continued to engage in recreational activities albeit less frequently.  He
argues that none of the experts who have assessed her have placed any
limitations on her activities, and that other than running, Ms. Davis has not
been substantially impaired from doing anything.  I am not persuaded by these
submissions.
[53]          
As previously mentioned, determining whether an
impairment is "important" requires a subjective assessment.  Impairment
related limitations may be important for one person, but not for another.  The
court's task in each case is to assess the impairment’s impact on the specific
injured individual before it. In fulfilling this duty, the central question is
the detrimental effect the impairment has on the life of that particular person.[10]
[54]          
In Ms. Davis’ case, the evidence presented at
trial was that she was an exceptionally active and social person.  She was
described as a happy, outgoing, energetic and independent.  The accident
directly resulted in limitations that manifest in her daily life, where she
struggles with memory issues, frequent headaches, and heightened sensitivity to
stimuli, which contribute to increased frustration and irritability. These
limitations have profoundly impacted her social and recreational life. Dr.
Mitchell, testified that Ms. Davis was tearful she recounted the effect the
injuries had on her limitations.  Her social and recreational activities were a
core aspect of her life and her identity, yet the accident has left her with
little energy to engage in them after work.   Drs. Sweet, Moustgaard, and Robinson
also testified that Ms. Davis became tearful when discussing the activities she
could no longer enjoy. The jury implicitly acknowledged the significance of Ms.
Davis' loss of amenities of life by awarding her $200,000 in general damages.
[55]          
It is to Ms. Davis’ credit that she has
continued to engage in recreational activities, to some extent, as recommended
by her doctors.  But her ability to engage in them in a limited way does not
make her loss of function trivial, unimportant or tolerable.  On the contrary,
the court is convinced that the limitations stemming from her impairments have
significantly disrupted essential aspects of her life, robbing her of joys that
constituted the very core of her identity.
[56]          
I find that the plaintiff has established a
permanent, serious impairment of an important physical, mental or psychological
function resulting from the motor vehicle accident of October 8, 2017. 
Accordingly, the defence motion is dismissed.
