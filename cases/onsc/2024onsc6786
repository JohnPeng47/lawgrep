[1]              
The Defendant, Canadian Pacific Railway Company
(“CPR”), moves for summary judgment to dismiss this action as statute-barred.
CPR states that the action was commenced well past the applicable six-year
limitation period.
[2]              
For the reasons below, I grant the motion. I
find that the action is statute-barred.
[3]              
In January 1990, the Plaintiff, 863880 Ontario
Inc. (“863”), a property developer, entered into an agreement of purchase and
sale with the predecessors of the Defendant companies. The agreement was to
purchase a parcel of land called the CPR/Marathon Property in what is now known
as Liberty Village in Toronto. The sale closed in November 1990. At the time, 863
and its affiliates were involved in developing Liberty Village. They acquired
various adjacent parcels of land over the course of many years as part of this
project. The CPR/Marathon Property is one of the most significant parcels
within the development.
[4]              
In January 2004, 863 commenced this action,
seeking damages in respect of the presence of certain contaminants on the
CPR/Marathon Property. The contaminants include volatile organic compounds,
primarily trichloroethylene and its degradation compounds. I will refer to
these as “TCE Contaminants” and to the phenomenon as “TCE Contamination”.
[5]              
863 states that it learned of the TCE
Contaminants on the CPR/Marathon Property in 1998, after it engaged an
environmental consultant, Decommissioning Consulting Services Limited (“DCS”),
to conduct certain investigations in relation to its proposed purchase of
property to the south of the CPR/Marathon Property, called the Inglis Lands.
Accordingly, says 863, it commenced this action within six years of learning of
the TCE Contamination.
[6]              
CPR alleges that 863 in fact knew of the TCE
Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property in April 1991, after having received
four reports about the TCE Contamination from different environmental
consultants. CPR states that, based on these four reports, 863 not only knew
that there was TCE Contamination at that time, but also knew that the presence
of the TCE Contamination would make it more expensive and more challenging to
develop the CPR/Marathon Property. However, 863 made a business decision not to
commence its claim at that time.
[7]              
863 disputes this claim, stating it knew there
was TCE Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property, but did not know the extent
of the TCE Contamination or the mechanism by which the TCE Contaminants had
reached the CPR/Marathon Property until it received its report from DCE (the
“1998 DCS Report”). It says that discoverability is, in these circumstances, a
genuine issue requiring trial.
[8]              
CPR seeks summary judgment on the basis that the
action was not started within the six-year limitation period in place at the
time.
[9]              
The Supreme Court of Canada
has confirmed, in Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, that the
ultimate question in a motion for summary judgment is whether there is a
genuine issue requiring a trial. The Court held that a genuine issue requiring
trial does not exist if the motion provides a process that allows a judge to
make the necessary findings of fact, allows the judge to apply the law to the
facts, and is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to
achieve a just result than going to trial.
[10]          
On a motion for summary judgment, I must first
determine, based only on the record before me, whether there is a genuine issue
requiring a trial. If there appears to be a genuine issue requiring a trial, I
am to determine if the need for a trial could be avoided by using my enhanced
powers under either Rule 20.04(2.1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”), which powers enable me to weigh evidence,
evaluate a deponent’s credibility, and draw reasonable inferences from the
evidence; or Rule 20.04(2.2), which powers allow me to order that oral evidence
be presented by one or more parties. I may use these powers at my discretion,
as long as their use is not against the interests of justice – that is, as long
as they will lead to a fair and just result and will serve the goals of
timeliness, affordability, and proportionality in light of the litigation as a
whole (Hyrniak, at para. 66).
[11]          
I am entitled to presume that the parties have
put forth their best evidence on the motion and that if the case were to
proceed to trial, no additional evidence would be presented (TD Waterhouse
Canada Inc. (TD Waterhouse Private Investment Advice) v. Little, 76
C.C.E.L. (3d) 243, 2009 CanLII 43663 (ON SC), at para. 15).
[12]          
I am to consider CPR’s motion for summary
judgment based on the limitation period in force at the time 863 commenced its
action. That limitation period, as established in section 45(1)(g) of the Limitations
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, is six years “after the cause of action
arose”.
[13]          
In considering discoverability for the purposes
of this limitation period, the so-called discoverability factors enumerated in
the successor Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B.
apply. Those factors are set forth in section 5(1), which provides:
[14]          
The Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Nasr
Hospitality Services Inc. v. Intact Insurance, 2018 ONCA 725, 142 O.R. (3d)
561 (at para. 35), confirmed that in a motion for summary judgment based on a
limitation period, I am to determine whether the record before me enables me to
make the following findings of fact, with the degree of certainty required by Hyrniak:
[15]          
The onus lies on CPR to show there is no
issue requiring trial with respect to the expiry of the six-year limitation
period (AssessNet
Inc. v. Taylor Leibow Inc., 2023 ONCA 577, 168 O.R. (3d) 276, at para. 34; Clearway Construction Inc. v. The City
of Toronto, 2018 ONSC
1736, 89 C.L.R. (4th) 222, at para. 55). CPR must show that 863 knew or
ought reasonably to have known of the elements of s. 5(1)(a), set forth above,
more than six years prior to commencing the proceeding (AssessNet, at
para. 35).
[16]          
The case law is clear that a plaintiff does not
have to have perfect or complete knowledge for the limitation period to start
running. Rather, it must have “enough facts on which to base its allegations” (The
Investment Administration Solution Inc. v. Silver Gold Glatt & Grossman LLP,
2011 ONCA 658, 107 O.R. (3d) 795, at para. 15).
[17]          
Thus, in Zeppa v. Woodbridge Heating &
Air-Conditioning Ltd., 2019 ONCA 47, 144 O.R. (3d) 385, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario held that the limitation period started running when the
plaintiff knew that the defendant HVAC system installer had installed the
system at issue and that the system was not working properly from the start. It
was not necessary for the plaintiff to know “how it happened” (at paras. 38-39
and 42-43).
[18]          
In Peixeiro v. Haberman, 1997 CanLII 325 (SCC), [1997] 3
S.C.R. 549, the Supreme Court of Canada discussed the common law principle of
discoverability. It held that, for a limitation period to start running, all
that is required is for the plaintiff to “kno[w] that some damage has occurred”
and to have “identified the tortfeasor”. At that stage, “[t]he cause of action
has accrued.” The Court added that "[n]either the extent of damage nor the
type of damage need be known. To hold otherwise would inject too much
uncertainty into cases where the full scope of the damages may not be
ascertained for an extended time beyond the general limitation period” (at
para. 18).
[19]          
The issue in this motion is whether and to what
extent various reports from environmental consultants gave 863 knowledge of the
TCE Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property, such that the six-year
limitation period started running. I briefly consider below the various reports
cited by the parties, up to and including the 1998 DCS Report, which 863 says
informed it of the TCE Contamination and triggered the start of the limitation
period.
[20]          
In October 1989, CPR provided 863 with a report
authored by a firm called MacLarentech Inc. Hazardous Waste Specialists ("MacLarentech").
The MacLarentech report identified TCE Contamination in one borehole on the
CPR/Marathon Property. It found no significant levels of volatile organic
compounds (of which TCE is one example) in soil samples.
[21]          
863 then engaged a firm called Trow Geotechnical
Ltd. (“Trow”) to conduct a geotechnical assessment of the CPR/Marathon Property
and review the issues described in the MacLarentech Report. In March 1990, Trow
provided its first report. The report identified non-TCE contaminants and
estimated the costs of remediating their effects on the soil.
[22]          
In October 1990, one of 863’s affiliates, 921425
Ontario Limited (“921425”), received a further report from Trow about the
Inglis Lands (the “1990 Trow Report”). At the time, 863 was considering purchasing
the Inglis Lands. The 1990 Trow Report identified TCE Contamination in one of
seven monitoring wells in the groundwater on the Inglis Lands. It indicated
that the suspected source of the TCE Contamination was to the north of the
Inglis Lands, based on the fact that there was a higher concentration of TCE
Contaminants upgradient from the northern property boundary. Although the 1990
Trow Report did not expressly identify the property to the north of the Inglis
Lands, it is undisputed that the property to the north of the Inglis Lands is
the CPR/Marathon Property. The 1990 Trow Report further stated that whether the
land continued to be used for industrial purposes or was decommissioned for any
kind of redevelopment (industrial/commercial, or residential/parkland), it
would be “necessary to work with the owner of the property to the north to
further define the source and extent of the groundwater contamination” and “arrange
for appropriate remediation at the source and downgradient as may be required.”
[23]          
In January 1991, Trow provided 921425 with
another report (the “1991 Trow Report”). It discussed sampling that was done on
two monitoring wells located on the CPR/Marathon Property. Based on this
sampling, the 1991 Trow Report concluded that the concentrations of TCE
Contaminant were “significantly higher” upgradient. This, in turn, “suggest[ed]
that contamination may be migrating onto” the Inglis Lands “from” the
CPR/Marathon Property. The report also indicated that the TCE Contamination
“has been observed to be ingressing to the site from the north” (where the
CPR/Marathon Property is).
[24]          
863 then retained two firms, DCS and Angus
Environment Ltd. (“Angus”), to assist in its assessment of the TCE
Contamination on the Inglis Lands.
[25]          
DCS in turn retained Golder Associates Limited
(“Golder”) to investigate the groundwater on the Inglis Lands, and in April
1991, Golder issued its report (the “1991 Golder Report”). Golder’s
investigation included groundwater sampling from monitoring wells on the
CPR/Marathon Property. The 1991 Golder Report indicated that laboratory results
from those samples “confirmed the presence of elevated concentrations” of TCE
Contaminant. It also found TCE Contamination on the Inglis Lands. It said it was
“not clear where the actual source or sources of TCE [were] located.”
[26]          
In April 1991, Angus issued a letter outlining
its analysis (“the “1991 Angus Letter”). It said the following:
[27]          
The development of Liberty Village did not move
forward, and 863 did not direct any further environmental investigations, until
1998, when 863 and its affiliates engaged DCS to do a re-assessment of the
Inglis Lands. The 1998 DCS Report was delivered. It indicated that TCE
Contamination was “determined to be present in the groundwater on the CP lands”
and that spills of TCE had probably occurred on certain of those lands.
[28]          
863 states that it was only with the benefit of
the 1998 DCS Report that it discovered the TCE Contamination on the
CPR/Marathon Lands.
[29]          
863 submits, first, that it was only through the
1998 DCS Report that it learned that the volume of contaminated soil was
significant. The previous four reports on which CPR relies – namely, the 1990
Trow Report, the 1991 Trow Report, the 1991 Golder Report, and the 1991 Angus
Letter – did not indicate that there was any significant TCE Contamination on
the CPR/Marathon Lands and instead described the Contamination as “localized”
and “minimal”.
[30]          
863
further states that the previous four reports did not
indicate the source of the TCE Contamination, which was a sewer within the CP
rail corridor that discharged volatile organic contamination into the Liberty
Village Lands.  This information was disclosed only in the 1998 DCS Report.
[31]          
CPR submits that the case law does not support 863’s
claim that it needed to know the significance or the source of the TCE
Contamination issue for the limitation period to start to run. CPR maintains
that by 1991, when the 863 had the four reports cited above, it had knowledge
of the TCE Contamination and the limitation period began.
[32]          
I find that 863 had actual knowledge of the
presence of TCE Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property, sufficient in
nature to trigger the start of the limitation period, in April 1991. I make
this finding based on the record before me and without having to rely on any of
the enhanced fact-finding powers set forth in Rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2).
[33]          
In my view, by April 1991, 863, having received the
1990 Trow Report, the 1991 Trow Report, the 1991 Golder Report, and the 1991
Angus Letter, had “enough facts on which to base its allegations” against CPR. Based
on those reports, 863 knew the following:
[34]          
I am unable to accept 863’s submission that these
four reports merely pointed to localized and minimal TCE Contamination. The
monitoring wells where TCE Contamination was found were specific locations, but
that does not mean, and the reports did not suggest, that the TCE Contamination
was itself localized. Nor did anything in the reports suggest that the TCE
Contamination was minimal.
[35]          
Nor can I accept 863’s submission that the
reports did not contain enough information about the extent or source of the
TCE Contamination for the limitation period to start. As discussed above, the
jurisprudence is clear that 863 did not need perfect or complete knowledge for
the cause of action to accrue. It did not need to know the extent or type of
damage involved. It only needed to know the facts on which to base its
allegations. I have found that 863 knew those facts: it had actual knowledge,
based on the reports, that loss or damage had occurred in the form of TCE
Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property and that the TCE Contamination was
caused or contributed to by an action or omission on the part of CPR.
[36]          
Notably, 863’s representative acknowledged
during examinations for discovery that by 1991, 863 had information about TCE
Contamination on the CPR/Marathon Property. He was asked if this information
gave rise to any concern. His answer was, “Not really.” His evidence was that
863’s concern was with contamination on the Inglis Lands, and the CPR/Marathon
Property was something “we would deal with, but the question was whether to buy
additional land.” He later explained, “When the time came to develop” the
CPR/Marathon Property, “we would have to address the contamination there.”
[37]          
He further testified that no one at 863 was
thinking at this time about giving notice to CPR about the TCE Contamination. He
did not know what giving notice would accomplish, because 863 was focused on
deciding whether to continue to assemble land for the project based on this
information about TCE Contamination. He agreed with the suggestion that this
was something 863 would deal with in the future.
[38]          
This evidence further supports my finding of
actual knowledge on the part of 863.
[39]          
Accordingly, the motion enables me to make the
required factual findings and apply the law to the facts. I am also satisfied
that the motion is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means
to achieve a just result than going to trial. There is therefore no genuine
issue requiring trial in respect of the expiry of the limitation period. Summary
judgment is appropriate.
[40]          
CPR’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
863’s action against CPR is dismissed.
[41]          
The parties have not provided any submissions on
costs. If they are unable to resolve the issue of costs on their own within 30
days, they are to notify me, and I will set a schedule for the provision of
brief costs submissions.
