1                    This motion to adjourn a trial boils down to a very simple policy issue:  If a lawyer commits to appearing for a 10-day trial on a specific trial sitting – and if the trial is not reached – should the trial automatically carry over into the next (or subsequent) trial sitting(s)?  Has the lawyer made a blanket commitment to proceed with this trial, whenever it is called?
2                    The Respondent mother’s December 10, 2024 motion requests:
3                    The mother’s December 10, 2024 affidavit includes the following narrative:
4                    The father’s December 12, 2024 affidavit includes the following narrative:
5                    The mother’s December 16, 2024 responding affidavit includes the following narrative:
6                    The non-disclosure issue is much more important than the father contends.
7                    I accept that this is primarily a parenting dispute.
8                    Although the father’s disclosure was inexcusably -- and unexplainably -- late, during the intervening period sufficient time has elapsed that many of the disclosure deficiencies or questions could have been addressed.
9                    So while there are many relevant considerations here, ultimately the adjournment request boils down to the delicate balancing of judicial availability and solicitor availability.
10               The obvious best result would be to roll the matter over to the next trial list and hope that it gets called in January 2025.
11               But our family court system needs to consider many factors, including encouraging and respecting the solicitor-client relationship.
12               The motion for the adjournment is granted.  (Both counsel confirmed that, if necessary, they are available for the sittings of October 6, 2025.)   The 8-to-10 day trial is adjourned to the sittings of October 6, 2025, Purge Court September 29, 2025 at 9 a.m.
13               The motion for costs “thrown away” is dismissed.
14               I am also not prepared to deal with the father’s request for costs in relation to the November 18, 2024 Purge Court attendance with Justice Walters.  Costs should be dealt with at each step, and Justice Walters’ endorsement is silent on the issue of costs.
15               I am prepared to deal with costs in relation to today’s motion.   I would remind the parties however about divided success (the mother was successful on the adjournment; the father was successful resisting the very sizeable “costs thrown away” request).  If the parties cannot resolve costs, written submissions (no longer than two pages, including hyperlinks, plus any offers) to be served on the following schedule:
16               Finally, the mother has requested a further Settlement Conference.  This is where we need to get the parties to pay more attention to this file.
