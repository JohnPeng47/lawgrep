I granted Nedaneg Financial Corporation’s (“Nedaneg”), appeal of
Associate Judge La Horey’s dismissal of its motion for a certificate of pending
litigation (“CPL”).
[2]              
Nedaneg requests costs on a substantial indemnity basis in the amount of
$109,000 or on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $80,000.
[3]              
The parties have agreed that the only issue is the scale of costs and
that the numbers submitted by Nedaneg are agreeable depending upon the scale.
[4]              
For the reasons that follow I award Nedaneg costs on a partial indemnity
basis in the amount of $80,000.
[5]              
Pursuant to s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. C.43, costs are in the discretion of the court. Rule 57 of the Rules sets
out the factors which courts should have regard to when awarding costs. The
overall objective is “to fix an amount that is fair and reasonable for the
unsuccessful party to pay in the particular proceeding, rather than an amount
fixed by the actual costs incurred by the successful litigant”: Zesta
Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier (2002), 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON CA), 21 C.C.E.L. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at
para. 4; Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario
(2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at para. 26; Clarington (Municipality) v.
Blue Circle Canada Inc., 2009 ONCA 722, 100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 52; and G.C.
v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 ONSC 1191, at para. 5.
[6]              
The court has the discretion to award substantial indemnity costs, but
such costs are “rare and exceptional” and only warranted where there has been
reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of a party: see DUCA
Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. v. Bozzo, 2010 ONSC 4601, at para. 5; Foulis
v. Robinson (1978), 1978 CanLII 1307 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.); and most recently Mars
Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash & Carry Inc., 2018 ONCA 239, 140 O.R. (3d)
81, at para. 43.
[7]              
In this case, while there was a finding of a strong prima facie case of
fraud, Nedaneg has not yet won the case.
[8]              
In my view the matters cited which include one of Respondents not
attending for cross examination and well as Pedram’s improper refusals are not
sufficiently scandalous or outrageous.
[9]              
The fact that two of the properties were sold after the dismissal of the
CPL motion and pending appeal also does not justify an elevated costs award. Nedaneg
provided no caselaw that suggested that a party could not deal with its
properties pending appeal of a dismissed motion for a CPL.
[10]          
Therefore, I award the agreed upon amount of $80,000 in partial
indemnity costs payable within 15 days.
