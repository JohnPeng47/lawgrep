[1]              The applicant’s Notice of Motion of February 1, 2024, sought exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and its contents and orders for the control of the sale of the property and for the disposition of the net proceeds.  The respondent’s Cross-Motion of August 7, 2024, sought the dismissal of the applicant’s motion, the transfer of the applicant’s interest in the matrimonial home to the respondent or, if the property was sold, a division between the parties of the proceeds.
[2]              In the result, I order that the property be listed for sale forthwith, that the parties shall use a real estate agent and lawyer of the applicant’s choosing, and that each party shall receive twenty-five percent of the net proceeds with the balance remaining in trust pending further order.
[3]              The parties married on September 23, 1995, and separated on November 22, 2021.  They continued to reside in the matrimonial home at 222 Golf Course Road, Callander, Ontario, until October, 2022, when the respondent paid to the applicant an uncharacterized sum of $200,000.00 and she moved out.
[4]              The applicant wife indicates that she was a stay-at-home mother for their three children.  They are now adults, but she says that she has also been a stay-at-home grandmother for their granddaughter.  She describes her employment history as part-time and low income.
[5]              The respondent husband was employed as a heating and sheet metal worker.  He bought into and became a partner in KRB Mechanical Ltd., then became its sole owner in or about 2018.
[6]              The wife’s Application was issued on April 6, 2022, and amended on September 19, 2024.  She claimed for a divorce and other relief including exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and its contents, an unequal division of property in her favour, and spousal support.
[7]              The respondent’s amended Answer denies the applicant’s claims.  He in turn claims, in addition to a divorce, property relief including exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and its contents, partition and sale of the matrimonial home, and an unequal division of property, in his favour.
[8]              Interim spousal support of $9,665.00 per month payable by the respondent to the applicant commencing March 1, 2023, was ordered after a contested motion.
[9]              The matter has not resolved through negotiation or conferencing.  It is scheduled for a seven-day trial commencing on July 2, 2025.
[10]         The parties’ major assets include the matrimonial home, KRB Mechanical Ltd., a holding company, the cash surrender value of some life insurance, RRSPs, TFSAs, and a collection of collector’s and recreational vehicles.  All but the matrimonial home and some investments are said to be in the respondent’s name alone.  The applicant had some investments in her name.  The matrimonial home is in joint names.
[11]         There were also some debts, including a line of credit, a mortgage, and credit cards.
[12]         The applicant’s draft Net Family Property Statement as of February 1, 2024, showed the respondent owing her an equalization payment of $1,395,562.00, subject to some disputed items.  That statement assigned the matrimonial home, valued therein at $850,000.00, to the respondent.  The respondent has not filed a Net Family Property Statement.
[13]         The applicant’s Notice of Motion of February 1, 2024, sought:
[14]         The respondent’s Notice of Motion of August 7, 2024, sought orders that:
[15]         The relevant sections of the Partition Act are:
[16]         Those of the Family Law Act are:
[17]         There is a plethora of cases dealing with applications for the partition and sale of lands in the family law context.  A non-exclusive list of the legal principles drawn from these that are applicable in interim motions in family cases to sell jointly-owned matrimonial homes was set out by Pazaratz J. in Dhaliwal v. Dhaliwal[1] which decision was referred to with approval by the Divisional Court in Noguiera v. Noguiera[2].  The list was set out again by Pazaratz J. in Ricketts v. Ricketts[3] and by Piccoli J. in Sidhu v. Kaur[4].  Paragraph 16 of Dhaliwal reads as follows:
[18]         The decision in Goldman v. Kudeyla[5] was referred to by Pazaratz J. but only with respect to a limited issue.  However, it also continues to be cited frequently for its concise statement of the approach to interim motions of the sale of a matrimonial home.[6]  At paragraphs 17 and 18, McGee J. stated:
[19]         The applicant wife has a prima facie right to the order she seeks for the sale of the matrimonial home, subject to the question of whether the respondent’s family law interests would be prejudiced.  The respondent offered a variety of reasons why the sale should not be ordered.  Instead, he primarily sought the transfer of the property to him.
[20]         His first reason was that he was advancing some claims under the Family Law Act.  One was for an unequal division of the net family property.  This relates to his business, KRB Mechanical Ltd., on the basis that he bought it, he did not use joint funds to do so, and it is solely in his ownership.  This sounds to me like throwback to the Family Law Reform Act approach to property, separating family assets from non-family assets, which the Family Law Act got away from.  However, I acknowledge that the Family Law Act does allow for unequal division in some circumstances, including those related to the acquisition, disposition, preservation, maintenance and improvement of property[7].  The respondent is free to advance such a claim, although its success and the implications for property division are, of course, unknowable at this time.
[21]         Furthermore, I note that most of the major assets, subject to some debts, are on the respondent’s side of the ledger.  The value of these, including of the matrimonial home, is uncertain.  Although there have been valuations and appraisals obtained, their validity and accuracy are in dispute.  There are also some accounting issues between the parties.  Consequently, there is no agreement on their respective net family properties, let alone on any equalization figure, or how to fund it.
[22]         In addition, there is an issue about double-dipping, as the business is both an asset potentially subject to an equalization claim and a source of income for spousal support purposes.
[23]         Nevertheless, it is expected that the respondent ultimately will have to make some equalization payment.  His affidavit of January 31, 2023, recognizes that it might be quite large.  The applicant’s current estimates, based on scenarios using various asset values from the business valuations and different allocations between the parties of the matrimonial home’s value, range from about $424,000.00 to nearly $1.8 million being owed to her.  Even with all of the issues raised by the respondent with respect to valuation, accounting and property division, there is no suggestion on his behalf that he would be the one owed an equalization payment or that the transfer of the home to him would be required in order to satisfy such.
[24]         The primary relief requested by the respondent would require the determination of the values of the encumbrances, of the post-separation accounting and of the equalization that are expected to be in issue at trial.  Consequently, that relief is not currently available on an interim basis.
[25]         The respondent also submitted that he has a competing claim for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and that ordering the sale would ignore his right to have the claim heard at trial.  Indeed, both parties claimed exclusive possession in their respective pleadings.  There is currently no order for it in favour of either.
[26]         McGee J. observed in Jiang v. Zeng[8] at paragraphs 36 and 37:
[27]         Of the criteria that the court is directed to consider, only s. 24(3)(c) might apply in the circumstances of this case.  However, the respondent has not shown any reason for his having exclusive possession of the matrimonial home after trial.  His Answer/Claim by Respondent proposed listing it for sale.  His Notice of Motion primarily seeks the transfer of the applicant’s share of the matrimonial home to him.  There is nothing in his affidavits, factum or submissions showing why he would need exclusive possession of the matrimonial home in lieu of a sale or of a transfer to him.  Indeed, his claim for this relief appears only to reflect the fact that she had moved out and left him with de facto possession of the matrimonial home pending its sale.
[28]         As noted, another of the respondent’s reasons for opposing the sale of the matrimonial home is that he wants to purchase it.  This is not relief that can be ordered.  Although there is authority to order the sale of the matrimonial home, there is no authority to order that the applicant’s share be transferred to the respondent.[10]  This issue was dealt with by Charney J. in Lowe v. Lowe[11] who summarized the law on point as follows[12]:
[29]         In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the respondent has met his onus of showing that he has a legitimate family law claim that would be unfairly prejudiced by the sale of the matrimonial home.  Consequently, I order that the home be listed for sale, forthwith.
[30]         The applicant’s motion sought an order that she have exclusive possession of the matrimonial home until the sale.  At this point, however, the respondent has occupied the home since the applicant moved out.  I see no reason to disturb that status quo pending the sale.
[31]         The applicant also sought to have carriage of the sale without the need for the respondent’s signature, and to use the real estate agent and lawyer of her choosing.  The respondent’s response in the event of a sale had only to do with the disposition of the net proceeds.  I see no reason not to allow the applicant to use the agent and lawyer of her choice.  However, as there is no indication that the respondent would not cooperate with the sale process (his Notice of Motion in fact contemplated the possibility of a sale), I will not dispense with the requirement for his signature on the sale documents.  Of course, if there was to be conflict over the sale process, a further short motion could be brought to resolve that and to fix costs.
[32]         The applicant’s motion sought payment of the net proceeds of sale to her, or payment of one half to her with the other half remaining in trust, or the retention of the full amount in trust.  In the event of a sale, the respondent sought $275,091.34 for himself and that at least $245,580.83 be paid to the applicant, based on calculations that were contested.  The applicant characterized her request as an advance on equalization, which she said she needed in order to retain counsel for trial.  In this regard, I note that she has some investments in her name, she received an uncharacterized payment of $200,000.00 from the respondent after separation, and she receives substantial monthly spousal support.  Her most recent financial statement is from January, 2023, and pre-dates the commencement of spousal support payments.  Therefore, it is not clear that she has any need for such an advance.  However, as previously noted, the respondent was not adverse to some division of the proceeds of sale.  Given the uncertainty around the issue and the numbers, it would be unwise to fix a payment at any large number.  Consequently, I order that each shall receive twenty-five percent of the net proceeds, with the balance remaining in trust.
[33]         Costs are reserved to the trial judge.
