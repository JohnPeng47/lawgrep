The parties, Bita Khoshbin (“Applicant”, “Ms. Khoshbin”) and Mehrdad
Shirvani (“Respondent”, “Mr. Shirvani”) had a relationship between 2015 and
2020.  They have two biological children.  The Respondent stood in the place of
a parent for the Applicant’s eldest child.  The children are 10, 7 and 5 years
old.
[2]              
The relationship was volatile with numerous separations.
[3]              
As observed by Justice Kristjanson in an earlier endorsement, both
parents have been convicted of assault on the other. Mr. Shirvani took care of
the children from July 30, 2020 until July 07, 2021. Ms. Khoshbin was in jail
for part of this time. Mr. Shirvani provided primary care to the children
during this period. Mr. Shirvani was then charged with assault on Ms. Khoshbin
in September 2021 after which she took on primary care of the children.

A 2023 VOC clinician report recommended the following:
[5]              
The parties were set to have a nine-day trial on November 11, 2024.  The
issues for the trial were parenting, decision-making and child support.
[6]              
At an exit pre-trial conference on October 21, 2024, Justice Hood noted
that the Respondent has been unable to exercise his alternate weekend parenting
time as he lost his job in March 2024 and lacks a suitable visiting space. 
Justice Hood noted that the original clinician, Mr. Reid, had recently
suggested that an updated report would be “very helpful due to recent changes
with the children.”  Justice Hood accordingly rescheduled the trial for
September 22, 2025.  He then granted “leave for either party to bring a
one-hour motion to vary the current parenting time arrangements and child
support.”
[7]              
Ms. Khoshbin deposes that an updated OCL report has been requested.
[8]              
Ms. Khoshbin has brought this motion seeking the following:
[9]              
The Applicant attended with counsel.  The Respondent attended,
self-represented.  The OLC clinician, Mr. Reid, also attended.  The Court excused
Mr. Reid as the written record provided a sufficient basis to proceed.
[10]          
No facta were filed.  Mr. Shirvani acknowledged receiving notice of
today’s motions.  He filed no materials.
[11]          
Ms. Khoshbin’s counsel points out that she has had de facto
parenting and decision-making for three years.
[12]          
Given Ms. Khoshbin’s uncontested evidence and the recommendations
contained in the 2023 OCL report, I am persuaded on a balance of probabilities
that awarding her primary parenting, sole decision-making, and travel without
the need for the father’s consent is in the children’s best interests.
[13]          
Notwithstanding his lack of materials, I asked the Respondent to comment
on the suggestion of parenting time on Saturdays.  Mr. Shirvani advises that he
currently lives 150 kilometers from Toronto.  Accordingly, my order will grant him
parenting time for 4-6 hours on Saturdays conditional on one week’s notice to
Ms. Khoshbin.
[14]          
I am unable to impute $60,000 of income to the Respondent. The only
information in support of this amount is the mother’s sworn belief that it is
reasonable.  This is an insufficient basis for imputing income: Drygala v. Pauli, 2002 CanLII 41868 (ON
CA).
[15]          
The mother suggests that the father’s NOA from approximately 2020 to
2022 suggest an income of $25,000.  Those notices could not be found in the
record.
[16]          
The Applicant’s request for child support is dismissed without prejudice
for her to file a new motion supported by the necessary evidence to determine
or impute an income to the Respondent.
[17]          
The Applicant requests costs of $2500.  She has prevailed on part of her
motion and the Respondent did not submit any materials.  I find these costs
appropriate.
[18]          
In conclusion, I make the following order:
