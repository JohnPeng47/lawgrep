[1]              
Duy Tam Nguyen operated a “stash house” which
the police searched and where they found significant amounts of cocaine and
methamphetamine and two firearms.  Following a trial, Mr. Nguyen was convicted
of two counts of possession of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking
(Counts 1 and 5), possession of a non-restricted firearm without being the
holder of a licence (Count 2), possession of a restricted firearm without being
the holder of a licence (Count 3) and possession of cocaine for the purpose of
trafficking (Count 6). He was acquitted of possession of proceeds of crime not
exceeding $5000 (Count 4).
[2]              
The following reasons explain the sentences that
will be imposed in this case.
[3]              
The facts are set out in detail in my reasons
for judgment, reported as R. v. Nguyen, 2024 ONSC 3144. Briefly, an
undercover police officer purchased crystal methamphetamine and cocaine from a
man named Saengsouly Phankham on several occasions
in February and March 2021 and Mr. Nguyen was observed meeting with Mr.
Phankham immediately before some of the purchases.  Mr. Nguyen and Mr. Phankham
were arrested on March 16, 2021, at which time the police found a bag
containing 174 grams of methamphetamine on Mr. Nguyen’s person.
[4]              
At the time of his arrest, Mr. Nguyen was in
possession of keys to a residence on Huron Street. The police executed a search
warrant there and found various drug trafficking paraphernalia, about 60 grams
of crack cocaine, 1.34 kilograms of powder cocaine and 386 grams of
methamphetamine.  They also found a loaded 20-gauge pistol-grip shotgun (a
“non-restricted firearm” as defined in s. 84(1) of the Criminal Code), a
.45 calibre handgun (a “restricted firearm”), a loaded magazine, and 100 rounds
of .45 calibre ammunition.  The evidence established that Mr. Nguyen had
knowledge and control of all of these items and was therefore legally in
possession of them.
[5]              
A report prepared by D.C. Rob Asner, whom
counsel agreed should be qualified as an expert in the distribution, sale,
packaging and pricing of cocaine and methamphetamine, was admitted on consent
for its truth.  According to him, the methamphetamine found on Mr. Nguyen’s
person was worth between $3,115 and $4,359 if sold by the ounce and between
$10,462 and $13,950 if sold by the gram.  The crack cocaine seized at the Huron
Street address was worth between $2600 and $3200 if sold by the ounce and
between $4771 and $5964 if sold by the gram.  The powder cocaine was worth
between $48,240 and $73,700 if sold by the kilogram and between $106,880 and
$133,600 if sold by the gram. The methamphetamine seized during the execution
of the warrant was worth between $6,895 and $9,651 if sold by the ounce and
between $23,163 and $30,884 if sold by the gram.
[6]              
Mr. Nguyen is 39 years old. He and his siblings
were born in Canada to Vietnamese refugees. According to a report prepared by Carole
Eastman, a Certified Addiction Counsellor, Mr. Nguyen experienced various forms
of complex trauma throughout his life, although the details surrounding this
are unclear as Mr. Nguyen would prefer not to share them for personal reasons. 
According to the report, he was beaten by his father as a form of discipline. 
Mr. Nguyen also experienced anti-Asian racism while growing up.  He now makes
his living as an automotive detailer.
[7]              
Mr. Nguyen has ongoing addiction issues and has
apparently been a user of cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs since he was
25 years old.  It is Ms. Eastman’s opinion that he has a severe substance use
disorder.  She believes that Mr. Nguyen now understands how his life
experiences have contributed towards problems in his life, including
involvement in the offences he is being sentenced for, and that he is prepared
to address them.
[8]              
Several letters written by Mr. Nguyen’s family
members, friends and business associates were filed at the sentencing hearing. 
They all speak of Mr. Nguyen in positive terms and describe the offences as
being out of character for him.
[9]              
In 2006, Mr. Nguyen was convicted of robbery,
use of an imitation firearm during the commission of an offence and being
disguised with intent to commit an indictable offence.  He received a sentence
of one year and five months in addition to 286 days of presentence custody.
[10]          
In 2010, Mr. Nguyen was convicted of possession
of a Schedule II controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking.  He
received a 12-month conditional sentence.
[11]          
After his arrest on March 16, 2021, Mr. Nguyen
was in custody until he was released on bail on April 8, 2021, a total of 23
days.  He was subjected to full or partial lockdowns on 11 of those days.
[12]          
While on bail, he was subject to house arrest and
GPS monitoring for 117 days.  Thereafter, he was subject to a curfew from 11:00
p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
[13]          
Section 718 of the Criminal Code provides
that the “fundamental purpose of sentencing is to
protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society….” 
This is to be accomplished through the imposition of just sanctions that have
one or more of several objectives enumerated in s. 718(a) to (f),
including denunciation, general and specific deterrence and rehabilitation.  As
the Ontario Court of Appeal observed in R. v. Morris, 2021 ONCA 680, 159
O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 58, the various objectives “will not necessarily point
toward the same sentencing disposition” and that the court must “prioritize and
blend the different objectives of sentencing so as to properly reflect the seriousness
of the offence and the responsibility of the offender.”
[14]          
While there will rarely be only one possible fit
sentence, s. 718.1 of the Code provides that any sentence that is
ultimately imposed “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the
degree of responsibility of the offender”: R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13,
[2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 37; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1
S.C.R. 424, at para. 30.
[15]          
The Crown seeks a sentence of four years on the
two counts of possession of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking
(Counts 1 and 5), six years consecutive for possession of cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking (Count 6) and three years consecutive for the two
firearm possession offences (Counts 2 and 3).  This would be a total of 13
years, which the Crown submits should be reduced to nine and a half years to
give effect to the principle of totality and various mitigating factors.
[16]          
The defence submits that the total sentence
should be five and a half years less credit for presentence custody (including
enhanced credit because of harsh custodial conditions) and time spent subject
to restrictive bail conditions, for a total of four years.
[17]          
Mr. Nguyen unlawfully possessed two firearms,
one of which was a handgun.  Firearms of this nature are manufactured for one
specific purpose, which is to terminate the lives of human beings, something
which can easily be accomplished with only a slight amount of pressure applied
to the trigger. They are instruments of death. The public threat posed by
firearms cannot be overstated.
[18]          
There is a well-established range of sentences
for firearm possession offences involving handguns of between two and five
years imprisonment for a first offence: R. v. Hussey-Rodgriques, 2024
ONSC 2671, at para. 88; R. v. Burke-Whittaker, 2024 ONSC 2906, at para.
27. The gravity of firearm possession offences is always significant, so where
an individual is situated within the range will depend on the offender’s level
of moral culpability. This often depends on the reason for which the firearm
was possessed.
[19]          
Where the firearm was possessed by an “outlaw
who carries a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm in public places as a tool
of his or her criminal trade,” the level of moral culpability will be high: R.
v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 51 (aff’d 2015 SCC 15,
[2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 82); R. v. Mohiadin, 2021 ONCA 122, at
para. 12.  Because of this, such offenders tend to receive sentences at the
higher end of the range: R. v. Graham, 2018 ONSC 6817, at para. 38,
aff’d 2020 ONCA 692, 474 C.R.R. (2d) 137; R. v. Marshall, 2015 ONCA 692,
340 O.A.C. 201, at paras. 47-49; R. v. Mensah, 2024 ONSC 2796, at para.
52.  In this case, the firearms were found at what is commonly described as a
“stash house,” that is, a location where illegal drugs intended for sale are
stored. They were clearly possessed as a “tool of the trade,” although there is
no evidence that they were possessed in public.
[20]          
Most, if not all, of these cases involved
convictions under s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code of possessing a firearm
that was loaded or with readily accessible ammunition.  Mr. Nguyen was
convicted under s. 91(1) of possessing a firearm without being the holder of a
licence, which is a less serious offence: R. v. Boussalas, 2015 ONSC
1536, at para. 14; R. v. Kennedy, 2016 MBCA 5, 323 Man. R. (2d) 265, at
para. 29.  That said, there was ammunition found for both firearms in this case.
I will, however, keep the distinction between the offences in mind when
determining the appropriate sentence.
[21]          
Mr. Nguyen possessed at total of 1396 grams of
cocaine (both crack and powder).  My colleague, Stribopoulos J., recently considered
the applicable sentencing range for cases involving similar amounts in R. v.
McAlpine, 2024 ONSC 797, 548 C.R.R. (2d) 53, at paras. 53-55:
[22]          
The sentencing range for possession of
methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking is less clear.  Sentences in the
upper single digits are not uncommon where multiple kilograms are involved: R.
v. Ticzon, 2018 ONCA 198, at paras. 10-12; R. v. Chanmany 2016 ONCA
576, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 578, at paras. 52-56; R. v. Oraha, 2012 ONSC 1439,
at para. 43; R. v. Wu, 2014 ONSC 6000, at para. 36.
[23]          
However, there appears to be less consistency in
the sentencing jurisprudence where smaller amounts of less than a kilogram are
involved, as in this case, which involved a total of 560 grams. Amounts of this
nature appear to attract sentences ranging from the upper reformatory range to
five years: R. v. Musa, 2022 ONSC 3734, at paras. 3, 55; R. v.
Shevalier, [2017] O.J. No. 7247 (C.J.), at paras. 5, 53, 58; R. v.
Bosnjak, 2023 ONCJ 608, at paras. 36,
145; R. v. Gagnon, 2017 ONSC 7470, at paras. 7, 59; R. v, Prestula, 2018
ONSC 4214, at paras. 5, 25; R. v. Bennett, 2023 ONCJ 616, at paras. 3-4,
35, 39.  The lack of clarity is perhaps due to the fact that in all of these
cases, the offender had been convicted of possessing more than one type of drug
and the sentences for possession of methamphetamine for the purpose of
trafficking were made concurrent to other sentences.
[24]          
The fact that Mr. Nguyen has a prior criminal
record is an aggravating factor. This is particularly true of the drug
offences, as he has a previous conviction for such an offence, albeit for a Schedule
II substance.  While Mr. Nguyen has no prior firearms convictions, he was
previously convicted of using an imitation firearm in the commission of an
offence.  However, the aggravating effect of this conviction is somewhat muted because
it occurred 18 years ago.
[25]          
Another aggravating factor is the apparent
sophistication of the trafficking operation.  The drugs were found together
with a variety of packaging paraphernalia in an apartment unit that appears to
have been rented for the sole purpose of being used as a “stash house.”  In
addition to this, the number of purchases made by the undercover officer show
that this was an ongoing endeavour.
[26]          
The fact that more than one type of drug was
involved is also an aggravating factor.
[27]          
As noted earlier, Mr. Nguyen appears to have
suffered some sort of trauma while he was younger, although the details
respecting this are unclear.  He was also the victim of anti-Asian racism.  However,
factors such as these are only relevant where they have some connection to the
offence: Morris, at
para. 97; R. v. Bertrand Marchand, 2023 SCC 26, 487 D.L.R. (4th)
201, at para. 128.  There is no clear connection in this case.
[28]          
The materials filed at the sentencing hearing
suggest that Mr. Nguyen has recently gained some insight into his conduct and
has expressed an intention to change the trajectory of his life.  This,
together with his employment history and his supportive family, all bode well
for his rehabilitation.
[29]          
Mr. Nguyen spent 117 days on bail subject to
house arrest, which should be taken into account in arriving at a fit sentence: R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79 O.R. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.), at
para. 33; R. v. Joseph, 2020 ONCA 733, 153 O.R. (3d) 145, at para. 108. 
Courts are not required to quantify a specific amount of credit, and doing so
risks skewing the calculation of the ultimate sentence: R. v. Marshall, 2021
ONCA 344, at para. 53.  When courts do quantify the credit, it is often between
a quarter and a third of the total time spent on bail: R. v. Long, 2021
ONSC 4747, at para. 39; R. v. Navarathinam, 2021 ONSC 4241, at paras.
47-51; R. v. Campbell, 2021 ONSC 4193, at paras. 15-20; R. v.
Inshanally, 2021 ONSC 3432, at paras. 35-37.  In this case, Mr. Nguyen is
entitled to a credit of 47 days for the time he spent subject to house arrest. 
For the remainder of the time he was on bail, Mr. Nguyen was subject to a
curfew and was also subject to GPS monitoring for a small portion of this
period.  In my view, there should only be minimal credit for this amounting to
21 days.
[30]          
Mr. Nguyen spent 11 days of his presentence
custody subject to lockdowns. The unacceptability of this practice has been the
subject of frequent judicial commentary and should be taken into account in
determining a fit sentence: R. v. Duncan, 2016 ONCA 754; R. v. Shaikh,
2024 ONSC 774, at paras. 22-30.  Mr. Nguyen is entitled to a credit of 17 days
for this.
[31]          
The total “Downes” and “Duncan”
credit is 85 days, or two months and three weeks, in addition to the usual
credit for presentence custody which is discussed later in these reasons.
[32]          
Having considered the applicable sentencing
range and the aggravating and mitigating factors, I must now determine the
appropriate sentence for each count.  In doing so, I must keep in mind the
principle of totality. The importance of this principle was recently explained
in R. v. M.V., 2023 ONCA 724, 169 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 100:
[33]          
The totality principle ensures proportionality,
but also ensures that the sentencing objective of rehabilitation is not
overshadowed by the competing objectives of denunciation and deterrence, as was
explained in R. v. Johnson, 2012 ONCA 339, 285 C.C.C. (3d) 120, at para.
18:
[34]          
As noted earlier, the possession of firearms in
this case was connected to drug trafficking.  Having considered the relevant
aggravating and mitigating factors, I have concluded that the appropriate
sentence for possession of a restricted firearm (Count 3) is four years.
However, to give effect to the principle of totality, the sentence that will be
imposed is three years.
[35]          
 The appropriate sentence for possession of the
non-restricted firearm (Count 2) is two years.
[36]          
Given the amounts involved and the sophisticated
nature of the operation, the appropriate sentence for possession of cocaine for
the purpose of trafficking (Count 6) would be six years, but the sentence that
will be imposed will be five years to give effect to the principle of totality. 
This sentence will be reduced by the two months and three weeks of “Downes” and
“Duncan” credit discussed earlier.  The sentence to be imposed will
therefore be four years, nine months and one week.
[37]          
As noted earlier, the range for possession of
methamphetamine of less than a kilogram for the purpose of trafficking is not
entirely clear.  Having considered similar cases and the factors in this case,
I am of the view that three years is appropriate for Count 5, which involved
386 grams, and two years is appropriate for Count 1, which involved 174 grams.
[38]          
It is well established that in cases of this
nature where firearm possession is linked to drug trafficking, the sentences
for the possession offences and the trafficking offences should be consecutive:
R. v. Crevier, 2015 ONCA 619, 330 C.C.C. (3d) 305, at paras. 128-129; R.
v. Graham, 2018 ONSC 6817, at para. 43.  However, the sentences for the two
firearm possession offences will be concurrent.
[39]          
The Crown submits that the sentences for the
cocaine and the methamphetamine convictions should be consecutive because they
involve different drugs.  I do not agree.  The fact that more than one type of
drug was possessed is an aggravating factor that has been considered in
determining the appropriate sentence.  In virtually all of the cases cited
earlier where more than one type of drug was involved, concurrent sentences
were imposed.  In my view, this is the correct approach for the reasons
explained in R. v. Felix, 2019 ABCA 458, 98 Alta. L.R. (6th)
136, at para. 81 (aff’d without reference to this point sub nom. R. v.
Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, [2021] 3 S.C.R. 366):
[40]          
In accordance with R. v. Summers, 2014
SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, Mr. Nguyen is entitled to a credit of 35 days, or
approximately one month and one week, for the 23 days he spent in presentence
custody.
[41]          
The sentences that are imposed are as follows:
[42]          
The total sentence is therefore seven years, nine
months and one week.  From this, a credit of one month and one week for 23 days
of presentence custody is to be deducted.  The sentence that remains to be
served is therefore seven years and eight months.
[43]          
Pursuant to s. 487.051(2) of the Criminal
Code, Mr. Nguyen is ordered to provide a sample of his DNA for inclusion in
the national databank.
[44]          
Pursuant to s. 109(3) of the Criminal Code, there
will be an order prohibiting Mr. Nguyen from possessing any firearm, cross-bow,
restricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substance for life.
