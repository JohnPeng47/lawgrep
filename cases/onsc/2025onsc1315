The Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on an unpaid loan in the amount of
$1,000,000 plus prejudgment interest at the contractual rate of 8 % from
January 15, 2018, to the date of judgment.
[2]              
For the reasons that follow I grant the judgment sought in the amount of
$1,445,673.52 which is the amount due and owing with interest as of March 31,
2023, with pre and post judgment interest at the contractual rate of 8 %.
[3]              
Before addressing the issues, it is important to set out a brief
recitation of the summary judgment test as follows.
[4]              
In accordance with r. 20.04(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”), the court shall grant summary
judgment if:
[5]              
In determining whether there is a genuine issue requiring a trial, the
court shall consider the evidence submitted by the parties and a judge may
exercise any of the following powers under r. 20.04(2.1): (1) weighing the
evidence; (2) evaluating the credibility of a deponent; and (3) drawing any
reasonable inference from the evidence.
[6]              
The Supreme Court of Canada in Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7,
[2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 49, explained:
[7]              
In order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the responding party
must put forward some evidence to show that there is a genuine issue requiring
a trial. A responding party cannot rest solely on allegations in a pleading. Each
side must “put their best foot forward” with respect to the existence or
non-existence of material issues to be tried: Mazza v. Ornge Corporate
Services Inc., 2016 ONCA 753, at para. 9. Furthermore, “a summary judgment
motion cannot be defeated by vague references as to what may be adduced if the
matter is allowed to proceed to trial”: Diao v. Zhao, 2017 ONSC 5511, at
para. 18.
[8]              
I agree that proceeding by way of summary judgment is appropriate.
[9]              
I have been able to make the necessary findings of fact, and summary
judgment is a proportionate, more expeditious and less expenses means to
achieve a just result.

The Plaintiff gave a $1,000,000 loan to two individuals, Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell, which loan was secured by a third mortgage over property located at 2194
Hampstead Road, Oakville, Ontario, L6H 6Y9 (the “Mortgage”). The mortgaged
property was owned by the Defendant.
[11]          
The Defendant provided a personal full and unconditional guarantee (the
“Guarantee”) of the Mortgage which provided as follows:
[12]          
Notably, the Guarantee specifies that it was given by the Defendant as a
principal debtor and not as a surety.
[13]          
As well, as further security for the mortgage, the Defendant provided a
collateral charge on property located in Florida at 517 Coconut Isle Drive,
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA (the “Collateral Mortgage”).
[14]          
The funds were advanced in three (3) tranches. The first advance of FOUR
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($400,000.00) was made on the closing of the
transaction on September 19, 2017. The second advance of THREE HUNDRED FIFTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($350,000.00) was made on September 20, 2017. The third
advance of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($250,000.00) was made on
December 8, 2017. The first four (4) months of interest and legal costs were
prepaid and deducted from each of the Mortgage advances. The first monthly
payment after the four (4) months of prepaid interest was due on February 15,
2018.
[15]          
  After the prepaid interest payments were exhausted, regular monthly
payments became payable commencing on February 15, 2018, in the amount of SIX THOUSAND
SIX HUNDRED SIXTY- SIX DOLLARS SIXTY-SEVEN CENTS ($6,666.67). No such monthly
payment was ever made, nor was any other payment made by the Defendant and/or
the Campbells following that date.
[16]          
Thus, the Mortgage and Collateral Mortgage have been in default since February
18, 2018, when the Campbells and the Defendant failed to make the first monthly
interest-only payment then due and payable.
[17]          
Further, the Mortgage matured on September 15, 2018.
[18]          
The Plaintiff issued and served a Notice of Sale on March 6, 2020.
[19]          
The property secured by the Mortgage was sold by the first mortgagee on
June 30, 2020, under power of sale. The Plaintiff did not receive any funds
from this sale.
[20]          
In or around October 2020, the Campbells went bankrupt.
[21]          
The Plaintiff attempted to proceed with enforcement of the Collateral
Mortgage in Florida. The Collateral Mortgage specified incorrectly that it was
given to secure a guarantee of a promissory note executed in Canada in the
amount of $1,000,000. This was incorrect as there is no evidence of any
promissory note. The Plaintiff made demands on the Defendant in Florida, but
his counsel objected to the validity and enforcement of the Collateral Mortgage
because no promissory note exists between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. He asserted
that in the absence of a promissory note, it is well-established in Florida law
that a lender cannot seek recovery of amounts allegedly owed by a borrower.
[22]          
In April 2022, the Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defendant
on the Guarantee in Ontario. The Plaintiff says that he has not abandoned
enforcement of the Collateral Mortgage in Florida, but determined that he would
proceed with its action on the Guarantee in Ontario and then proceed with its
enforcement in Florida.
[23]          
The Plaintiff served its motion for summary judgment on January 20,
2023.
[24]          
On or about January 20, 2023, the Defendant then made an assignment in
bankruptcy.
[25]          
On March 22, 2023, the Plaintiff obtained an order lifting the automatic
stay.
[26]          
The Plaintiff’s affidavit evidence sets out that the amount due and
owing in respect of the Charges and therefore guaranteed by the Defendant is $1,445,673.52
as of March 31, 2023.
[27]          
This is uncontradicted by any evidence.
[28]          
The Defendant has admitted that he signed the Commitment, the Acknowledgment
and Direction re the Charge and Collateral Charge and has not disputed that he
signed the Acknowledgement re Standard Charge Terms.
[29]          
He has admitted that he understood the nature and effect of his personal
Guarantee, that he was not coerced into entering into it, that the moneys were
fully advanced, that the Mortgage went into default on February 18, 2018, and
that he has made not payments on the Mortgage.
[30]          
The Defendant argues that Ontario lacks jurisdiction because the
Collateral Mortgage provides that it shall be governed and construed by the
laws of the State of Florida.
[31]          
The Defendant’s argument must fail for the following reasons:
[32]          
The Defendant also argues that Florida would be the more appropriate
forum, but this argument must also fail for the following reasons:
[33]          
The Defendant also argues that there is something nefarious about the Plaintiff
suing on the Guarantee in Ontario after the Defendant raised issues with
enforcement of the Collateral Mortgage. I see nothing wrong with this. The only
thing that this motion will decide is whether or not the Defendant is liable on
the Guarantee. The Defendant can still raise arguments about whether or not the
Collateral Mortgage can be enforced in the absence of a signed promissory note.
As well, on this issue, I note that there is no expert evidence before me that
supports what the Defendant says about a mortgage being unenforceable in the
absence of a signed promissory note.
[34]          
Therefore, I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence and award the Plaintiff
judgment in respect of the Guarantee in the amount of $1,445,673.52 which is
the amount due and owing with interest as of March 31, 2023, with pre and post
judgment interest at the contractual rate of 8 %.
[35]          
There is no genuine issue for trial.
