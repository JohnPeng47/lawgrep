[1]         Pursuant to my Decision on Motion released on August 22, 2024, I have received and considered the Costs Submissions of Mr. Aiello dated September 12, 2024, and his Costs Outline dated September 6, 2024, the Costs Submissions of Ms. Machado dated September 26, 2024, as well as the Reply of Mr. Aiello dated October 1, 2024.  On behalf of his client, as he did for my latest Addendum on Costs from November 24, 2023, Mr. Madhany chose not to file written submissions since the defendant Mr Lowery is not seeking costs from any party and no party is seeking costs from him either on this interim motion.
[2]         Counsel for the defendant, Temagami Barge, submits that this Court should fix a partial indemnity costs award of $25,520.68 inclusive of fees, disbursements and taxes, payable by the plaintiff to Temagami Barge within 30 days.  Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the Court should not order any costs for the motion or order that costs should be in the cause.  In the alternative, it is submitted that costs should be reduced to $8,000 to account for the mixed results on the motion and the defendant’s vague Costs Outline.
[3]         I agree with the submission by Counsel for the plaintiff that, in assessing costs, the Court “is required to consider what is “fair and reasonable” having regard to what the losing party could have expected the costs to be”: Pack v. Cord Blood Bank of Canada Inc., 2023 ONSC 3227, at para. 11.
[4]         This Court’s exercise of discretion for costs determinations is founded in s. 131 of the Court of Justice Act:
[5]         Costs awards are “quintessentially discretionary.”:  Restoule v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 ONCA 779, at para. 344, relying on Nolan v. Kerry (Canada) Inc., 2009 SCC 39, at para. 126.
[6]         Traditionally, the purpose of an award of costs within our “loser pay” system was to partially or, in some limited circumstances, wholly indemnify the winning party for the legal costs it incurred.  However, costs have more recently come to be recognized as an important tool in the hands of the court to influence the way the parties conduct themselves and to prevent abuse of the court’s process.  Specifically, the three other recognized purposes of costs awards are to encourage settlement, to deter frivolous actions and defences and to discourage unnecessary steps that unduly prolong the litigation:  1465778 Ontario Inc. v. 1122077 Ontario Ltd., 2006 CanLII 35819, 82 O.R. (3d) 757 (C.A.), at para. 26.
[7]         In the civil law context, the relevant factors in that exercise of discretion to fix costs is outlined in Rule 57.01(1) as follows:
[8]         Absent special circumstances, costs follow the event.  “It is worth repeating that a costs award does not have to be measured with exactitude; rather, it should reflect a fair and reasonable amount that should be paid by the unsuccessful parties.”:  Butler v. Royal Victoria Hospital, 2018 ONCA 409, at para. 18.
[9]         In exercising discretion, the “overriding principle” in fixing costs is to fix an amount that is “fair and reasonable”: Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at para. 24; see also, Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. David Cloutier, 2022 CanLII 25577 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 4; Coldmatic Refrigeration of Canada Ltd. v Leveltek Processing  LLC (2005), 2005 CanLII 1042 (ON CA), 75 O.R. (3d) 638 (C.A.), at para. 8.
[10]      As recently outlined in Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly Canada Inc., 2022 ONCA 587;
[11]      Fixing the appropriate costs award requires a two-part analysis.  Firstly, I must undertake a critical analysis of the relevant factors in exercising my discretion including relative success or failure from the interim motion, Rule 57.01(1), and any other matter relevant to the question of costs claimed.  Secondly, and only then, am I to “step back and consider the result produced and question whether, in all the circumstances, the result is fair and reasonable.”  And in this two-part analysis, the failure to consider and undertake a critical analysis of the relevant factors before “stepping back” is an error.
[12]      Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the result of the motion was mixed, and that the potential prejudice of the refusals that were upheld outweighs the probative value of the questions that must be answered from my Decision on Motion.  Therefore, the plaintiff suggests there should be no costs for the motion or costs should be in the cause.
[13]      Alternatively, Counsel for the plaintiff submits that costs should be reduced due to the mixed results on the Motion and the defendant’s vague Costs Outline, and as well that the more than $25,000.00 in partial indemnity costs sought by the defendant is also not fair or reasonable.
[14]      In Whitfield v. Whitfield, 2016 ONCA 720, the Ontario Court of Appeal outlined the following;
[15]      In Seelster Farms Inc. v. Ontario, 2017 ONSC 5895, Justice Emery of this Court stated the following in declining to make an order for costs when the costs outline provided insufficient detail:
[16]      Counsel for the plaintiff further submits that the amount of costs claimed lacks clarity and is unreasonable and excessive for the reasons as submitted.  I note that there is not a specific breakdown of the 31.5 hours claimed to the fee items outlined in the Costs Outline, and I would have preferred such a delineation of these total hours claimed for my consideration.  Also, I note that Counsel for the moving party defendant is seeking an hourly rate of $562.50 as a partial indemnity rate, which I calculate to be 75% of his $750.00 actual rate.
[17]      The Ontario Court of Appeal in Bondy-Rafael v. Potrebic, 2019 ONCA 1026, indicated at paragraph 57:
[18]      The Court of Appeal for Ontario’s decision in Whitfield v. Whitfield, 2016 ONCA 720 is instructive in this regard as follows:
[19]      As I determined on November 24, 2023, I once again do not see this interim motion to be one of those rare and exceptional cases where substantial and full indemnity costs are justified, and I do not understand that Counsel for Temagami Barge is arguing for such an award since the claim is for a discounted partial indemnity rate from his actual rate.  The Whitfield decision provides this guidance on the question of what amount of partial indemnity costs should be awarded:
[20]      I agree that a costs award should follow the overall outcome of a hearing rather than the proportion of issues on which a party succeeded or failed.  I have also not been made aware of any offer to settle this interim motion made in writing.  I have also considered the principle of indemnity including the experience of the lawyer for the party entitled to the costs as well as the rates charged and the hours spent by that lawyer, the amount of costs that an unsuccessful party could reasonably expect to pay in relation to this step in the proceeding, the complexity of the proceeding and the importance of the issues, the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceedings, as well as a party’s denial of or refusal to admit anything that should have been admitted.
[21]      Having undertaken my critical analysis of the relevant factors here as applied to the costs claimed, and then stepping back and considering the result produced as well as the application of the principle of proportionality and questioning whether, in all these circumstances, the result is fair and reasonable, I have been satisfied to fix an award of costs for this interim motion in the amount of $12,500, all-inclusive of fees, disbursements and HST, to be payable by the plaintiff to the moving party defendant Temagami Barge within 30 days.
