[1]              
The plaintiff fell down the stairs of her rental unit when she slipped
on snow and ice on the front staircase.
[2]              
The defendants were her landlords. She commenced this proceeding. The
defendants did not defend and were noted in default.
[3]              
This matter proceeded to an undefended trial before me.
[4]              
For the reasons that follow I grant the plaintiff judgment in the amount
of $150,000 for general damages, out of pocket expenses in the amount of
$635.57, future care costs in the amount of $12,000 plus costs in the amount of
$36,058 inclusive of HST on a partial indemnity basis as well as disbursements
in the amount of $11,000.80.
[5]              
Pursuant to r. 19.02, having not defended the proceeding, a defendant is
deemed to admit the truth of all allegations of fact made in the Statement of
Claim.
[6]              
Pursuant to the Occupiers Liability Act, R.S.O., 1990, C. 0.2, an
occupier owes a duty of care to ensure that persons entering onto premises, are
reasonably safe.
[7]              
In Wilson v 356119 Ontario Ltd., 2023 ONSC 600, from paras 24 to
38, Dolyle J. provided a helpful analysis of cases involving the liability of
occupiers in cases of slip and fall. The cases are fact specific, and factors
that a court considers in determining whether the occupier fell below the
standard of care include the weather, the time of year, the cost of
preventative measure, the nature of the property and the quality of footwear
worn by the visitor. Occupiers have been found liable for failing to apply salt
in a timely and appropriate manner resulting in the creation of ice, and for
the failure to remove snow and ice.
[8]              
I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the defendants
were “occupiers” within the meaning of the Act. I am also satisfied that they
failed to take reasonable care to ensure that the Property was reasonably safe
for persons on the Property, based upon the following deemed admissions in the
Statement of Claim as well as the testimony of the plaintiff before me:
[9]              
Pursuant to r. 19.06 a plaintiff is not
entitled to judgment on a motion for judgment or at a trial merely because the
facts alleged in the statement of claim are deemed to be admitted, unless the
facts entitle the plaintiff to judgment.
[10]          
Here, the plaintiff testified as to her
significant and ongoing injuries in this matter which were also supported by
her medical records and by her expert. I found her testimony reliable, credible
and believable. She had good recall of the events in question.
[11]          
After the accident, the plaintiff was taken from the Property to the
hospital. She had swelling in her knee with limited range of motion. An x-ray
showed a lateral tibial plateau fracture. The physician on call recommended
surgery to place a metal plate and screws into her leg, which surgery was
conducted by an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. George Vincent, on February 12, 2016.
[12]          
The plaintiff’s injury and operation was serious enough that she
remained in hospital until February 19, 2016. She was discharged wearing a
large plaster cast and had to use a wheelchair and crutches because she could
not put weight on her leg.
[13]          
For many years, her knee throbbed and she had difficulty walking or
standing for any extended periods of time. She also had the feeling of pins and
needles in her leg.
[14]          
On February 27, 2019, she had a second surgery to remove the plate and
screws as it was thought this could improve her pain. The surgery did improve
her pain somewhat but she still had difficulty walking and still used a cane.
She would have a sharp pain in her meniscus that would come out of nowhere, and
her leg would also swell up and hurt all over at times.
[15]          
Her family physician then arranged an MRI that occurred on December 4, 2020,
which showed the following:
[16]          
Her final appointment with her orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Vincent was on
August 12, 2021. She was five years post the accident, and her knee was
swelling and throbbing. He could not offer her any solutions.
[17]          
She did not schedule any follow up visits or see Dr. Vincent again because
her physicians told her that her knee had healed as best it could. She
understood that she would have to deal with the pain and live with it, which is
what she has tried to do.
[18]          
The plaintiff continues to have significant pain to this day. She tried
many different pain medications, attended physiotherapy and had a cortisone
injection, but her pain continues.
[19]          
There is a long visible scar running down her leg from her knee. She is
embarrassed and tries to hide her scar. It also hurts.
[20]          
She continues to use cannabis for the pain.
[21]          
She has difficulty going up and down stairs. She can only go up or down,
one step at a time.
[22]          
She cannot bend her knee very well. As a result, she never squats to
pick things up but bends over which she knows is bad for her back, but she must
do this because of the pain she experiences when she bends her knee.
[23]          
She still uses a cane at times when her pain is extreme.
[24]          
She was unable to keep up with her parental responsibilities. During
these years, her children wanted to go out but she could not supervise them and
they had to stay home. She is still limited in recreational activities that she
can do with her children. She is concerned because her youngest child is 9
years old and he will need her to be more active but she has difficulty.
[25]          
As well, in the early days of her injury, the medication gave her mood
swings and this also affected her relationship with her children.
[26]          
She can no longer have intimate encounters because of pain and because
of her feelings of being ugly.
[27]          
The plaintiff obtained an expert opinion from Dr. Rick Zarnett, an
orthopaedic and Arthroscopic Surgeon which was admitted pursuant to s. 52 of
the Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.  E 23. His opinion, dated January 23,
2017, is:
[28]          
He also opines that in all probabilities she will have some permanent
level of impairment and that she could need further surgery in the form of
arthroscopy or knee replacement. He reviewed literature that showed that
individuals with the type of injury the plaintiff had a 5.3 time increase in
the likelihood of such surgery compared to individuals in the general
population.
[29]          
Because it is not recent, I give it much less weight, but the note does
suggest that she is at risk of future surgery which I do accept. I do not that
most of what Dr. Zarnett predicted in his report did occur in the plaintiff’s
case.
[30]          
A defendant is liable for any injuries caused or contributed to by his
or her negligence: This test will be satisfied where it is shown that the
injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant, or that
it is a material cause of the injury: Athey v. Leonati, 1996 CanLII 183
(SCC) at paras 13 to 15.
[31]          
The plaintiff had no pre-existing conditions at the time of the incident.
She was active and in good health. She had just had a baby ten months ago.
[32]          
As well, the plaintiff had no accidents after this incident that could
have caused her damages.
[33]          
I am satisfied that the proximate and material cause of the plaintiff’s
injuries is the defendants’ negligence. Her injuries would not have occurred
but for the defendant’s negligence which caused her fall on February 10, 2016.
[34]          
I do find any basis for a finding that the plaintiff was contributorily
negligent. She had walked up and down these steps several times a day for many
months in the exact same way she did on the day in question, without incident.
She was also wearing shoes with a tread. Moreover, because the defendants did
not defend, her pleading that she was being prudent is deemed admitted.
[35]          
The plaintiff claims general damages, past out of pocket expenses and
future care costs for future expenses.
[36]          
The plaintiff referenced a significant body of caselaw which shows that
orthopedic injuries involving the tibia are serious. The cases referenced show
a range of damages from $115,000 to $175,000: Beardwood v. the City of
Hamilton, 2022 ONSC 4030; Maceachern v. TFG Inc., 2018 ONSC 242; Klurfeld
v. Nova Quest Logistics Inc., et al, 2014 ONSC 1538; Iacolucci v.
Fernbrook Homes (Brooklin) Ltd., 2006 CarswellOnt 9398. The plaintiff’s
injuries are similar to the injuries in these cases.
[37]          
Based upon the nature of the plaintiff’s injury, her period of recovery,
her ongoing challenges and the nature of her now permanent disability and pain,
I assess the plaintiff’s general damages in all the circumstances at $150,000.
[38]          
She incurred expenses for her wheelchair in the amount of $288.40 and
for medical marijuana in the amount of $347.17. I award these amounts.
[39]          
In order to establish future pecuniary losses, a plaintiff must show a
real and substantial possibility of a risk of future losses. This does not need
to be proven on a balance of probabilities but mere speculation will be
insufficient: Butler v. Royal Victoria Hospital, 2017 ONSC 2792 at para
197 citing Athey v. Leonati at para 27.
[40]          
The only drug that the plaintiff found assisted her pain is cannabis and
she has been using it since 2017.  The receipts that she provided show that she
will continue to spend approximately $400 per year for the next 30 years which
equates to $12,000.
[41]          
I find that she has shown a real and substantial possibility that she
will continue to need to use cannabis and award this amount for future care
costs.
[42]          
The plaintiff requests costs on a substantial indemnity basis in the
amount of $54,086 or in the alternative $36,058 on a partial indemnity basis as
well as disbursements in the amount of $11,000.80.
[43]          
Pursuant to s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. C.43, costs are in the discretion of the court. Rule 57 of the Rules sets
out the factors which courts should have regard to when awarding costs. The
overall objective is “to fix an amount that is fair and reasonable for the
unsuccessful party to pay in the particular proceeding, rather than an amount
fixed by the actual costs incurred by the successful litigant”: Zesta
Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier (2002), 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON CA), 21 C.C.E.L. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at
para. 4; Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario
(2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at para. 26; Clarington (Municipality) v.
Blue Circle Canada Inc., 2009 ONCA 722, 100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 52; and G.C.
v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 ONSC 1191, at para. 5.
[44]          
The court has the discretion to award substantial indemnity costs, but
such costs are “rare and exceptional” and only warranted where there has been
reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of a party: see DUCA
Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. v. Bozzo, 2010 ONSC 4601, at para. 5; Foulis
v. Robinson (1978), 1978 CanLII 1307 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.); and most recently Mars
Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash & Carry Inc., 2018 ONCA 239, 140 O.R. (3d)
81, at para. 43.
[45]          
The fact that the defendants did not defend and that the plaintiff had
to proceed to an undefended trial does not satisfy the test for substantial
indemnity costs.
[46]          
I award the plaintiff her partial indemnity costs and her disbursements
in full. She has provided a detailed Bill of Costs. The hours charged as well
as the rates are all fair and reasonable and the overall award is within the
reasonable contemplation of the defendants.
[47]          
Therefore, I award the plaintiff $150,000 in general damages, $635.57 in
out-of-pocket expenses and $11,000 for future care costs as well as $36,058 on
a partial indemnity basis as well as disbursements in the amount of $11,000.80.
[48]          
The prejudgment rate of 5 % shall apply to the general damage award and
post judgment interest at the rate in the Courts of Justice Act shall
apply.
