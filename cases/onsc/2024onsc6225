[1]             
In Reasons for Judgment released October 4, 2024, I granted the City of
Hamilton’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff’s action
against it, with costs as agreed or, failing agreement, as determined by me
following the delivery of costs submissions.
[2]          The
parties delivered costs submissions but before releasing a decision, I was advised
that an agreement had been reached on costs. The parties asked that this Decision
reflect their agreement.
[3]          I thank
the parties for settling costs, which is reflected in my order below.
[4]             
As agreed, the plaintiff is to pay the City of Hamilton’s costs of this
action and summary judgment motion in the all-inclusive amount of $200,000, payable
forthwith.
