[1]        
Tiffany Edey and Antonio Beccati had a
relatively brief and turbulent relationship.
[2]        
The parties started cohabiting on August 16,
2016.  They married on August 19, 2017, and separated on October 30, 2018.
[3]        
They have one child: 
Angelica Natalina Edey, born April 8, 2019.
[4]        
The parties settled the parenting issues mid-way
through the trial.  Tiffany has sole decision-making authority and primary care
of Angelica.  Antonio now has regular parenting time after not seeing Angelica
for several months.
[5]        
The trial was primarily about the financial
issues, particularly the circumstances surrounding the acquisition and subsequent
sale of the parties’ matrimonial home at 1700 Lake Ridge Road in Uxbridge (“the
Lake Ridge home”) which has emotional and symbolic value to both parties.
[6]        
The parties purchased the Lake Ridge home in
Tiffany’s name alone just prior to marriage.  Tiffany contributed the majority
of the down payment. Her income as a public school teacher was essential in
qualifying for the large mortgage.  Antonio is self-employed as a contractor. 
He has a history of earning a significant income but declaring very little.  As
Tiffany later learned, he also has a history of failing to pay his various
creditors.
[7]        
When the parties separated, Tiffany sought to
list the Lake Ridge home for sale.  Antonio was resistant.  On March 8, 2020,
Tiffany finally obtained an order directing the house to be sold.  The Lake Ridge
home sold on June 13, 2020.  It was later revealed that the purchaser was
Antonio. He had purchased it surreptitiously through a “straw purchaser”. 
Antonio took title through his solely owned corporation, the Respondent, 5034389
Ontario Inc. (“503”).
[8]        
Antonio later transferred the property to his
sister, the Respondent, Susanna Beccati.
[9]        
Tiffany asserts that Antonio was financially
abusive to her throughout their relationship.  His deception regarding the
sale/purchase of the matrimonial home was the final affront.  Tiffany asks the
court to set aside all of the transactions relating to the Lake Ridge home as
fraudulent conveyances and to vest title to the home in her sole name.  She has
also advanced a claim for damages for the tort of conspiracy in relation to these
transactions.
[10]    
Tiffany would owe Antonio an equalization
payment and she is requesting an unequal division of property.
[11]    
Tiffany is seeking to impute an income to
Antonio for the purpose of paying child and spousal support.
[12]    
Antonio advanced few financial claims other than
for reimbursement of payments that he made toward the Lake Ridge home.
[13]    
The parties met through an online dating app in
2014.
[14]    
Antonio was married before and has two children
from his prior marriage.
[15]    
Tiffany and Antonio got
engaged in August 2015 and immediately started hunting for their dream home.  Tiffany
located the Lake Ridge home and they both decided that this was the one for them.  They put in an offer
to purchase for $1.1 million. Antonio provided a cheque for the deposit of
$30,000 and reassured Tiffany that they would be able to qualify for a mortgage
with his income.  Tiffany put her townhouse up for sale and it sold within a
week.
[16]    
Tiffany used the full sale proceeds from her
townhouse, $343,217, toward the down payment of the Lake Ridge home. At the
last minute, the mortgage lender told them they needed to come up with additional
funds despite having earlier provided a mortgage commitment.  Tiffany later found out that this was because Antonio’s $30,000 deposit
cheque had bounced, which would be a sign of things to come. Antonio advised
that he had $97,000 in his bank account earmarked to pay income tax and he
provided these additional funds to satisfy the lender’s criteria.
[17]    
Tiffany’s evidence was that the home was put in
her sole name as she had paid the majority of the down payment and because of
Antonio’s business and his creditors.  Antonio was to make the mortgage
payments and he was expected to match her contribution within the year.
[18]    
The parties started living together in their new
home around August 16, 2016, and they married on August 19, 2017.  Their relationship
was rocky from the start.
[19]    
The parties separated on October 30, 2018, before
Angelica’s birth, although they continued to live separate and apart in the
home for a period of time.
[20]    
Tiffany had a very difficult pregnancy and
required emergency medical intervention for the delivery.  Angelica was
transferred to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto where she stayed for
two weeks.  Her doctors were not sure if she had suffered brain damage. 
Thankfully, this turned out not to be the case, but this experience had a
lasting, traumatic impact on Tiffany in particular.
[21]    
After Angelica was released from hospital, Tiffany
and the baby went to stay with her parents.  Tiffany still wanted to move back
to the Lake Ridge home, but Antonio deterred her from returning, saying that he
was working on some renovations.  Eventually, Tiffany and Angelica returned on June
10, 2019.  The parties continued to live there, albeit separate and apart.
[22]    
Antonio had been inconsistent in contributing to
the household expenses prior to separation.  His contributions to the household
expenses became even smaller and less regular post-separation.  Tiffany, who
was on maternity leave, relied on her savings, personal lines of credit and
loans from her parents to make the payments.
[23]    
Antonio resisted selling the Lake Ridge home
even though it appeared that neither of them could afford to carry it.
[24]    
Tiffany commenced this Application on June 3,
2019.
[25]    
When Antonio purportedly agreed to list the
house for sale, Tiffany moved out with Angelica on September 17, 2019.  In his
Answer, Antonio agreed that the matrimonial home should be sold. However, he
continued to frustrate Tiffany’s efforts to move forward with this.
[26]    
On March 2, 2020, on a contested motion brought
by Tiffany, Leef J. ordered that the matrimonial home would be sold with a
listing date of no later than April 1, 2020.  Antonio was granted exclusive
possession of the home and was to pay the carrying costs on the home.  Leef J.
also ordered that upon the closing each party should receive $97,000 from the
net proceeds with the balance held in trust.
[27]    
The parties had discussed the possibility of
Antonio purchasing the home from Tiffany, but they were not able to reach an
agreement.  Antonio continued to delay the listing of the home, contrary to
Leef J.’s order.  He also deliberately failed to maintain the home in proper
condition for showings.
[28]    
Ultimately, the home was
sold to 503. Antonio is the sole shareholder and a director of this corporation. 
The details of that transaction will be discussed further in the analysis of
Tiffany’s fraudulent conveyance claim below.
[29]    
On January 4, 2021, 503 transferred the Lake Ridge
home to Susanna Beccati, in trust for no consideration.  Antonio did not reveal
that this transfer had taken place.  In fact, he swore more than one Financial
Statement after the transfer in which he showed that he was still the legal owner
of the property.  When Tiffany discovered that Antonio had made this further
transfer, she brought a motion on June 5, 2023, and obtained an order for a
certificate of pending litigation:  see Edey v. Beccati, 2023 ONSC 3447 per
Finlayson J.
[30]    
During the courtship, Antonio had presented as
generous and appeared to be financially healthy.  However, after the parties
started to live together, Tiffany was required to assume responsibility for
many of the household expenses.  Antonio used Tiffany’s credit cards and most,
if not all, of the family’s bills were put into Tiffany’s name.   Antonio was
inconsistent with his contributions to the household finances.  Many of Tiffany’s
accounts went to collections around or after separation.  Tiffany did not learn
about this until later as the bills were still being sent to the matrimonial
home and she had moved out. The Canada Revenue Agency contacted Tiffany
regarding unpaid taxes because Antonio had claimed that he was renting the
matrimonial home from her.
[31]    
Antonio was ordered to pay temporary child
support and to contribute to the cost of daycare for Angelica.  At the time of
trial, he was in arrears of child support in excess of $14,000 and had unpaid
costs.
[32]    
In McBennett v. Danis, 2021 ONSC
3610, 57 R.F.L. (8th) 1, at paras. 40-41, Chappel J. set out an excellent
summary of the law with respect to credibility and the factors for the court to
consider:
[33]    
 Tiffany described a
series of traumatic events that she has experienced over the last few years. The
most significant of which was the circumstances
surrounding her pregnancy and delivery of Angelica.  It is not necessary to
recite this evidence in detail, but it was evident that Tiffany continues to be
emotionally impacted by these events.
[34]    
Tiffany often presented as frustrated, angry and
upset, in some respects with good reason.  At times I found her evidence
exaggerated, particularly in relation to the parenting issues, which ultimately
settled mid-trial.  On key points, however, I found her forthright, and her
oral testimony was typically supported by the documentary evidence.
[35]    
In certain limited aspects of his evidence, Antonio
was forthright and prepared to admit some of his shortcomings, particularly in
relation to the parenting issues.  However, when it came to the financial
issues, I found Antonio to be evasive and his evidence unreliable.
[36]    
Antonio failed to produce significant
documentary disclosure, contrary to specific orders and undertakings.  Antonio’s
oral evidence was problematic, and he was unable to back up many of his claims
with supporting documentary evidence.
[37]    
Antonio sought to present himself as a simple man
who worked hard in his contracting business and left the details to the hired
professionals.  When presented with inconsistencies in his financial evidence,
Antonio frequently blamed others, including his accountant(s), his several
lawyers and others. I do not accept Antonio’s self-portrayal.  I find that he
was well able to marshal his resources for things that were important to him,
such as purchasing and retaining the Lake Ridge home or keeping his motorcycle loan in good standing.
[38]    
There were numerous contradictions in Antonio’s evidence. 
The following are just a few examples:
[39]    
Overall, I frequently found Antonio’s evidence
less than credible and generally unreliable.
[40]    
 Luigi Beccati is Antonio’s brother.  Luigi’s
evidence was that he assisted Antonio with the initial purchase of the Lake Ridge
home and that he continues to provide him with financial assistance.
[41]    
Luigi was unable to remember where he got the
money for the initial purchase of the Lake Ridge home.  He could not recall if
he paid $20,000 or $25,000.  He claimed that maybe someday he would like to be
repaid.  However, Antonio and Susanna Beccati both said that he was already repaid.
[42]    
Luigi professed not to know how much money he
had provided Antonio.  He could not remember why his parents’ home, in which he
had an interest, was transferred to his sister.
[43]    
I found Luigi’s evidence on key points evasive
and lacking in credibility.
[44]    
Susanna Beccati was party to the litigation. 
However, she never participated in any of the intervening court events.  She
did not file an Answer and was noted in default on the first day of trial.
[45]    
Susanna Beccati, who is currently the primary
borrower for mortgages in excess of $800,000, professed not to remember what
her income was in 2023.  She advised that she typically earns about $50,000 per
year as a travel agent.  She did not know the renewal date for the mortgage or the
interest rate of the Lake Ridge home mortgages.
[46]    
Susanna Beccati also claimed not to know why she
came to be the sole owner of her parents’ home previously owned by her father
and brother, Luigi Beccati.
[47]    
Susanna Beccati frequently responded that she
did not remember or could not recall.  I found Susanna Beccati’s evidence
similarly evasive and unreliable.
[48]    
 Nadine Lubin is Antonio’s current partner.  She
is also a public-school teacher.  Nadine Lubin lives with Antonio in the Lake Ridge
home.
[49]    
 I found Nadine Lubin to be somewhat more direct
and forthright in her evidence.  However, when it came to discussing Antonio’s
mortgage payments, Nadine Lubin followed the same script as Antonio’s other witnesses: 
she had no idea how much money she had contributed to the mortgage; she and the
others were all pitching in because that was what family did, etc. On the point
of Antonio’s mortgage payments, she was less credible.
[50]    
 Antonio pleaded that he was entitled to a
one-half interest in the matrimonial home and that Tiffany was holding 50% of
the property in trust for him.  He did not specify the remedy he was seeking (i.e.,
constructive or resulting trust).    Antonio did not specify this as relief
being sought either in his trial opening statement or in closing submissions.
[51]    
In the case of married parties, trust claims
must be resolved before the equalization payment is calculated:  McNamee v.
McNamee, 2011 ONCA 533, 106 O.R. (3d) 401.
[52]    
 The three-part test for the equitable claim for
unjust enrichment was set out in Kerr v. Baranow, 2011 SCC 10, [2011] 1
S.C.R. 269, at paras. 38 – 40.  Simply put, the party advancing the equitable
claim bears the burden of demonstrating that:  1.  The defendant was enriched;
2.  The plaintiff was correspondingly deprived; and 3. There was no juristic
reason for the enrichment.  See also Moore v. Sweet, 2018 SCC 52, [2018]
3 S.C.R. 303, at para. 43.
[53]    
It is not disputed that Antonio contributed
$97,000 toward the down payment of the Lake Ridge home.  However, Antonio did
not specifically claim that this payment formed the basis for an equitable
interest in the property nor did he lead the court
through the foundation for the claim or the nature of the remedy.
[54]    
Antonio has not discharged that burden and his
trust claim is dismissed.
[55]    
Tiffany’s position is that she owes Antonio an
equalization payment of $208,533.12.
[56]    
Tiffany produced a Net Family Property Statement
dated November 21, 2023, and she produced documentary back-up. The Net Family
Property Statement contains numerous “TBD” items on Antonio’s side due to his
failure to provide disclosure.
[57]    
Antonio stated in oral evidence that he
disagreed with Tiffany’s Net Family Property Statement but could not say why
and produced little or no disclosure to refute her figures.
[58]    
Antonio produced a Net Family Property Statement
dated May 11, 2023, prepared with the assistance of a lawyer.  He then produced
another Net Family Property Statement dated June 2, 2024, mid-way through the
trial.  Both were improperly prepared.  The first omits any reference to the Lake
Ridge home and the associated mortgages.  The second shows Antonio as the sole
owner of the Lake Ridge home on date of separation. There are numerous TBD or
N/A items on Antonio’s side of the balance sheet in both versions.
[59]    
I have commented below on some of the more significant
discrepancies in the position of each party.
[60]    
Tiffany put the value of the matrimonial home,
which was solely owned by her on date of separation, at $1,170,000 on her NFP
statement. This is the appraised value that parties agreed to accept per the
order of Hughes J. dated August 18, 2023.  The parties separated 1.5 years
prior to the date of sale.  Even if parties had not otherwise agreed to these
values, I would accept the appraisal report as the best evidence of value as of
date of separation.
[61]    
Antonio had a significant debt to Canada Revenue
Agency on the date of marriage and, it appears on the date of separation
although the exact amounts due were not clear.  He did not include those debts
in his Net Family Property Statement and neither did Tiffany.  To the extent
that this debt increased over the course of the
marriage, it was Antonio’s obligation to assert the claim for a deduction.  I
have therefore not included this in the determination of the equalization
payment.
[62]    
Antonio did not allow a deduction for
disposition costs on Tiffany’s registered funds (pension and RRSP) on date of
separation (he put “N/A”).  I have accepted Tiffany’s stated deduction.
[63]    
In general, I have drawn an adverse inference
from Antonio’s failure to produce financial disclosure in support of the value
of his businesses on the date of separation as well as his date of marriage
debts.  It is possible that had proper disclosure been produced as ordered or
undertaken during questioning, there would be a significant difference in the
equalization payment in Tiffany’s favour.
[64]    
I accept Tiffany’s calculation of the
equalization payment, which is that she owes Antonio an
equalization payment of $208,533.12.
[65]    
  Tiffany is asking the court to find that there
should be an unequal division of net family property and that her equalization
payment be reduced to zero.
[66]    
Antonio did not make specific submissions with
respect to this claim. However, he agreed that he had no legal claim to the
balance of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home being held in trust,
having already received $97,000.
[67]    
Section 5(6) of the Family Law Act, R.S.O.
1990, C. F.3 (“FLA”) states that:
[68]    
The circumstances relied upon by the claimant must
fit into one of the enumerated grounds to support a finding of
unconscionability:  LeVan v. LeVan (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) (C.A.), at para.
40.
[69]    
It is not enough for the court to identify that
one of the enumerated grounds is present. Rather, the court must determine that
the ultimate result would be unconscionable.  In Serra v. Serra, 2009
ONCA 105, 93 O.R. (3d) 161, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that:
[70]    
The purpose of the equalization of net family
property provisions of the FLA is to
[71]    
Section 5(7) of the FLA is not a
stand-alone ground for the unequal division claim, but it informs the analysis: 
Brett v. Brett, (1999), 1999 CanLII 3711 (ON CA), 46 R.F.L. (4th) 433 at paras. 32-34.
[72]    
The parties cohabited from August 16, 2016, to
October 30, 2018: 26 months.  Angelica was born after the parties had already
separated.  In this case, the obvious ground that would apply for an unequal
division is s. 5(6)(e) of the FLA.
[73]    
Section 5(6)(h) of the FLA also has some
application here in terms of the acquisition and maintenance of the Lake Ridge
home.   Tiffany entered the relationship with significant assets and a secure
job.  The only reason these parties were able to acquire their dream home was
due to the large down payment provided by Tiffany and her secure income as a
teacher. Antonio represented to Tiffany that he ran a successful contracting
business and that with his income, they could carry the large mortgage.  He
agreed to match her contribution within the year and to carry the mortgage.  The
reality quickly turned out to be very different.  While I find that Antonio may
have made some payments, Tiffany was frequently required to make up the
shortfall and the couple’s other living expenses.
[74]    
Tiffany’s Net Family Property Statement was
properly prepared and does not include a date of marriage deduction for the
value of the matrimonial home on the date of marriage: see definition of “net
family property” at s. 4(1) of the FLA.  The application of the
statutory scheme is not in and of itself grounds to consider an unequal
division:  Ward supra, Linov v. Williams, 2007 CarswellOnt 1463
(Ont. S.C.), at para. 36.  However, most of the equalization payment due to
Antonio can be attributed to the fact that Tiffany is not entitled to deduct
the equity value of the home on date of marriage.  If Antonio was given a
corresponding deduction for his contribution to the down payment, it would not
change the ultimate equalization calculation as his net family property would
be negative and thus deemed to be zero:  s. 4(5) of the FLA.
[75]    
Courts have found that equalizing the parties’
net family properties produces an unconscionable result where one party has
brought a matrimonial home into a short marriage:  See Rivers-Eshkibok v.
Eshkibok, 2002 CarswellOnt 3920 (Ont. S.C.), aff’d  2003 CarswellOnt 2290
(C.A.), Stergiopoulos v. Van Biehler, 2014 ONSC 6391, 52 R.F.L. (7th)
470, and Kucera v. Kucera, (2005), 2005 CanLII 12854 (ON SC), 16 R.F.L. (6th) 250 (Ont. S.C.).
[76]    
I find that, in this case, it would be
unconscionable and shocking to the conscience of the court for Antonio to
receive the full equalization payment without recognizing the parties’ grossly disproportionate
contributions to the acquisition and maintenance of the matrimonial home as
well as Tiffany’s disproportionate assumption of the household finances having
regard to the short duration of the relationship.
[77]    
In determining to what extent the equalization
payment payable by Tiffany should be reduced, I considered various approaches. 
I looked at a percentage application of the duration of the parties’
relationship over the five-year threshold which is an approach that the Court
of Appeal has noted can be helpful in some cases:  Gomez v. McHale, 2016
ONCA 318, 79 R.F.L. (7th) 305, Booth v. Bilek, 2021 ONCA 128, 52 R.F.L.
(8th) 251.    I have also considered what the equalization payment would look
like if Tiffany and Antonio were both given date of marriage deductions
relative to their contributions to the matrimonial home per the authorities referred
to above.
[78]    
I find that it is fair, reasonable, and
equitable in all these circumstances for Tiffany to pay 20% of the equalization
payment, which I have rounded down to $40,000.
[79]    
Antonio was already paid $97,000 from the net
sale proceeds belonging to Tiffany. Therefore, he was overpaid $57,000 and
that sum is due to Tiffany.
[80]    
Tiffany is claiming child and spousal support
pursuant to ss. 15.1 and 15.2 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2nd Supp) (“Divorce Act”) based on an imputed
income to Antonio.
[81]    
Tiffany is seeking to impute an income of $175,000
to Antonio.
[82]    
Antonio has been a contractor since 1997. He
works through his corporation AB Solar Systems Inc. (“AB Solar”).  He has at
least one other, possibly related corporation called Beccati Contracting Inc.
that he claimed had not been in operation since April 2016 and had “government
debt of $102,000”.
[83]    
Antonio also had an interest in a business
called Woodwork Studio Inc.
[84]    
Antonio acknowledged that he worked long hours. 
Around the time Tiffany became pregnant with Angelica, Antonio was doing solar
panel installations for the Toronto District School Board with an engineering
firm.  He complained that the firm was always “stretching him out for payment”
and Antonio thought he might have lost a quarter of a million dollars in
relation to that project.  Antonio also did work for Tim Horton’s and Harvey’s
restaurants throughout Ontario and was away travelling for work for much of
Tiffany’s pregnancy.
[85]    
Antonio conceded that his income per his Notices
of Assessment did not accurately reflect his income for the payment of support
but stated that his income should be imputed at not more than $65,000.  In his Amended
Amended Answer/Claim dated July 24, 2023, Antonio admitted that his income from
AB Solar was between $70,000 and $80,000 per year.
[86]    
Antonio also stated that his income is now “way
less” but he provided no reasonable, credible explanation for why that might
be.
[87]    
Tiffany is relying on two grounds to support
imputation of income. The first ground is pursuant to s. 18(1) of the Federal
Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175 (“Guidelines”), which permits the court to adjust
income where a spouse earns income through a corporation and where the court is
of the opinion that the amount of personal income declared does not fairly
reflect the money available to that spouse from the corporation. The second is
under s. 19(1)(f) of the Guidelines which states that the court may
impute an income as it considers appropriate in certain circumstances including
when a “spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal
obligation to do so.”
[88]    
The onus is on Tiffany to establish the
evidentiary foundation for the imputation requested: Berta v. Berta,
2015 ONCA 918, 128 O.R. (3d) 730, at para. 63.  However, the onus may be discharged when there is a
failure to make financial disclosure: Graham v. Bruto, 2008 ONCA 260.
[89]    
The self-employed or those who have irregular
income and expenses have a positive obligation to put forward not only adequate
but comprehensive records of income and expenses meaning a package from which
the recipient can draw conclusions and the amount of child support can be
established:  Meade v. Meade (2002) 2002 CanLII 2806 (ON SC), 31 R.F.L.
(5th) 88 (Ont. S.C.) at para. 81.  Antonio did not do
that.
[90]    
Antonio failed to produce financial disclosure
regarding his income including the following:
[91]    
This disclosure was either previously ordered by
the court, or Antonio undertook to produce it during questioning, or both. The
disclosure is all basic and essential to permit the court to determine
Antonio’s income.
[92]    
The disclosure that Antonio did produce
regarding his income was confusing and unhelpful.
[93]    
Antonio provided his Financial Statements for AB
Solar for 2016-2022 which were prepared by a CPA.  He led little additional
evidence to assist the court in understanding his true income.
[94]    
The gross revenue of AB Solar taken from the
financial statements that were produced is as follows:
[95]    
 Tiffany summarized the deposits made to
Antonio’s bank accounts and he agreed with her math, but Antonio was unable to
explain why the gross revenue of his business was less than the deposits.
[96]    
In Antonio’s personal income tax returns that
were produced, he declares income from self-employment even though he
purportedly earns his income through his corporations.  In one set of business
financial statements, he was paid dividends of $194,000 in 2017 and in 2018 he
was paid dividends of $155,000.  Antonio did not deny receiving the dividends
but could not explain why revised financial statements prepared for the same
years did not refer to these dividends.
[97]    
Antonio’s stated wages from AB Solar (not
reflected in his personal income tax returns) were modest and typically less
than $30,000 per year. However, he had large expenses for sub-contractors each
year, typically in excess of $100,000.  Antonio did not explain who he was
hiring, for what purpose or if they were at arm’s length.  When Antonio was
explaining the nature of his business expenses, he stated that “most of the
expenses are materials, fuel, truck payments and if I hire
sub-contractors” [emphasis added].
[98]    
AB Solar consistently owed funds to a “related
company”; as of December 31, 2022, the sum of $49,300.  Antonio advised that
the only other related company was Beccati Contracting Inc., which had been
inactive since 2015.
[99]    
Antonio claimed the mortgage payments that he
was making on the matrimonial home as a business expense.  Tiffany received a
notice from the Canada Revenue Agency dated February 5, 2020, advising that AB
Solar Systems Inc. had transferred cash in the amount of $28,000 to her on
account of rent.
[100]Antonio
failed to produce proper financial disclosure to support his position on his
income.  The disclosure that he did produce was inconsistent and unreliable and
therefore not credible:  Iacobelli v. Iacobelli, 2020 ONSC 3625.
[101]As
noted above, Antonio sought to portray himself as a simple contractor with poor
record keeping.  He also frequently blamed others, including his accountant and
his lawyers, for any errors or omissions.  I do not accept this portrayal. 
Rather, I find that Antonio is a capable businessman who has been able to
generate significant earnings through his contracting business even through the
COVID-19 pandemic.  Furthermore, he has demonstrated that he is well able to
look after his personal interests.  He arranged to purchase the Lake Ridge home
with Tiffany and then to purchase it from Tiffany using a straw purchaser.  Later,
he transferred title to the property to his sister in a bid to judgment-proof
himself. Since purchasing the property from Tiffany, he has maintained the
mortgage payments, even as his child support has been consistently in arrears.
[102]I find
that Antonio’s failure to produce certain disclosure was deliberate and
designed to obfuscate the true picture of his income.  I have therefore had to
look to other indicators to reach an accurate determination of imputed income
for support.
[103]My
analysis is focussed on s. 19 (1) rather than s. 18 (1) of the Guidelines
as I did not have the evidence required to properly determine income under the
latter provision.
[104]Tiffany
argues that the court should look at Antonio’s budget and gross it up for taxes
to determine his imputed income.  I have considered this and a number of other
factors to determine the proper income to impute.
[105]Antonio
is obligated to pay child support to his ex-wife based on his income of
$105,000 from their separation agreement signed in 2013. There was no evidence
that this obligation had been varied.  In his affidavit for divorce sworn May
21, 2015, he states that his income is still $105,000 for the purpose of child
support.
[106]In his
Financial Statement sworn July 15, 2019, prepared by a lawyer, Antonio swore
that his income from employment was $84,000.  His income for the prior year was
listed as “Unknown”.  His annual expenses that year were $124,946.52, not
including utilities that were noted as being paid by Tiffany.  Despite this
significant disparity between income and expenses, Antonio’s only debts were a
small Mastercard balance ($500) and his motorcycle loan.  Antonio did not offer
an explanation as to how he was making ends meet.
[107]Antonio’s
2020 income tax return shows his prior year’s (2019) income as $25,000. 
However, his 2019 Notice of Assessment issued July 2, 2021, shows Line 150
income of $84,850.
[108]In his
Financial Statement sworn July 29, 2021, also prepared by a lawyer, Antonio
stated that his annual income from self-employment was $40,490 plus taxable
benefits of $25,493 for a total income of $65,983.  His budget had increased to
$132,061 Antonio now had a mortgage loan of $784,070.  Other than that, he
shows a small car loan, his motorcycle loan and a small balance due for his
2020 income taxes.
[109]Antonio
swore a further Financial Statement on May 11, 2023, again prepared by a
lawyer.  He stated his income was identical to the year prior:  $40,490 plus
$32,312 in taxable benefits from the corporation.  His expenses were
considerably reduced at $45,891.  Antonio now asserted that Nadine Lubin was
paying $2,500 toward the monthly mortgage payment of $7,242 and he was making
no contribution.
[110]In all
of his sworn Financial Statements, Antonio makes no reference to his
significant income tax liabilities that pre-dated the marriage.
[111]Having
regard to all of the evidence, I do not accept that the Lake Ridge home
mortgage is being primarily paid by someone other than Antonio.  I do accept
that very recently, Nadine Lubin may have been making a significant
contribution to this expense but that is more likely than not in support of
Antonio’s narrative that he does not have the income to sustain it.
[112]Luigi
Beccati and Susanna Beccati were unable to tell the court how much they had
contributed toward the mortgage or where the funds came from.  As noted above,
their evidence on this topic was scripted and evasive.
[113]Antonio
claimed to be borrowing money from family, but he had no idea how much the
“loans” might have been and there was no loan documentation as “they were
family”.
[114] I
find it more likely than not that Antonio has continued to make the majority of
the mortgage payments.
[115]If I
am wrong and it turns out that the payments are being made on Antonio’s behalf
by Luigi and/or Susanna Beccati and, as they deposed, they do not require
re-payment, this can still be considered by the court as a source of income as they
help Antonio establish a lifestyle and pay liabilities in excess of his means: 
Bak v. Dobell, 2007 ONCA 304, 86 O.R. (3d) 196, at para. 62; Korman
v. Korman, 2015 ONCA 578, 63 R.F.L. (7th) 1, at para. 64; Malkov
v. Stovichek-Malkov, 2017 ONSC 6822, at para. 69; and Peerenboom v.
Peerenboom, 2018 ONSC 7562, at para. 70.
[116]The
amount to be imputed under the Guidelines must be supported by the
evidence and consistent with the objective of establishing “fair support based
on the means of the parents in an objective manner that reduces conflict,
ensures consistency and encourages resolution”:  Korman, at para. 51,
citing Bak and Drygala v. Pauli (2002), 2002 CanLII 41868 (ON CA), 61 O.R. (3d) 711 (C.A.).
[117]To
summarize the foregoing:
[118]I find
that based on the evidence, Antonio shall be imputed with an income as follows
for the purpose of calculating his support obligations:
[119]Tiffany
is seeking child support retroactive to the date of separation pursuant to s. 15.1
of the Divorce Act.
[120]Tiffany
is presumptively entitled to support commencing from the date of the
Application which was June 3, 2019. This is not a retroactive support claim:  MacKinnon v. MacKinnon (2005), 2005 CanLII 13191 (ON CA), 75 O.R.
(3d) 175 (C.A.), at paras. 17-29.
[121]Tiffany
is claiming retroactive support from the date of Angelica’s birth two months
earlier which is appropriate having regard to the principles outlined in Colucci
v. Colucci, 2021 SCC 24, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 3; and Michel v. Graydon,
2020 SCC 24, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 763.
[122]The
monthly Table support payable based on my findings of Antonio’s income is as
follows:
[123]Antonio
was ordered by Hughes J. to pay temporary child support in the amount of $750
per month commencing October 1, 2020.  He was later ordered by Hughes J. to
contribute the sum of $580 per month per month toward Angelica’s day care
expenses on a temporary basis commencing October 1, 2021.  Antonio shall
receive credit for any payments made through the Family Responsibility Office
to date pursuant to these temporary orders.
[124]Tiffany
is advancing a claim for a variety of special and extraordinary expenses for
Angelica on a retroactive and ongoing basis.
[125]Section
7 of the Guidelines provides in part as follows:
[126]   Tiffany’s annual income for the purpose of calculating the parties’
proportionate share and assessing the necessity and reasonableness of the
expenses is as follows:
[127]Tiffany
is seeking a contribution to daycare expenses for Angelica.  Tiffany is also
seeking a contribution to the cost of private school.
[128]Angelica
attended daycare at the Town Centre Montessori school.
[129]In
September 2023, Angelica started school at the local public school.  Tiffany learned
that Nadine Lubin’s sister-in-law (the wife of Nadine’s brother) worked at the school,
and she greeted Angelica on the first day.  Tiffany was upset and spoke with
the Vice-Principal because she felt that this was a “conflict of interest”. 
Ultimately Tiffany removed Angelica from that school and enrolled her in
Milliken Mills Public School.  However, Angelica started to misbehave by
refusing to stay in class and leaving the school. Tiffany felt that the school
was negligent in its supervision of Angelica and removed her from this school.
[130]Tiffany
then enrolled Angelica in the Town Centre Montessori private school.  Tiffany’s
evidence was that Angelica is thriving at Town Centre Montessori and that the
environment provided more stimulation for her.  The cost of tuition at the
Montessori school is $1,545 per month.
[131]Antonio
acknowledged that he must contribute to the daycare expense, but he is opposed
to paying for private school.
[132]Daycare
is a special expense.  However, in order to qualify for sharing under s. 7 of
the Guidelines, the claimant must demonstrate that private school is an
extraordinary expense per the definition in s. 7(1.1)(b) of the Guidelines.
[133]There
was no evidence that the parties had discussed private school as an option for
Angelica prior to separation nor that Antonio had been consulted in a
meaningful way prior to Angelica being enrolled.  I do not find that the Montessori
program was needed to address any special need or talent on the part of
Angelica.  Lastly, I find that it is not reasonable to require Antonio to
contribute to this expense on top of his Table child support obligation given
the overall means of the parties.
[134]Tiffany
incurred the following qualifying daycare expenses:
[135]Tiffany
also incurred an expense for summer camp for Angelica.  I find that this is
akin to daycare as Tiffany picks up teaching work during the summer.
[136]The
summer camp fees are as follows:
[137]Tiffany
is claiming a variety of activity expenses for Angelica including swimming
lessons and gymnastics.
[138]The
activities that Angelica (now age 5) is engaged in are the usual activities for
children her age.  There was no evidence that these activities were
extraordinary having regard to the factors under s. 7(1.1)(b) of the Guidelines.
[139]Antonio
had at one time agreed to pay 50% of Angelica’s swimming lessons but that was
at a time when his Table child support was fixed at a lower amount that I have
ordered.  The Table support is appropriate to cover the expense of these activities
and this claim is dismissed.
[140] Tiffany is seeking a contribution the storage fees for Angelica’s
cord blood and tissue.  The cost is $235 annually with an initial fee of $1,700
which Tiffany has paid thus far.
[141]Tiffany’s
evidence was that she wanted Angelica’s cells stored in case she ever had a
disease.  There was no suggestion that Angelica was at high risk or that the
cord blood storage was recommended by her doctors due, for example, to some of
the health challenges she experienced shortly after birth.  Antonio acknowledged
that he contributes to this expense for his other two children per an agreement
with their mother.
[142]I am
unable to find that this expense qualifies as a special and extraordinary
expense.  See:  Umeya v. Tebit, 2014 ONSC 4887; and M.A. v. N.M., 2021 ONSC 5468, for
similar findings.
[143]For
the years in which Tiffany is claiming a contribution to special and
extraordinary expenses for Angelica, namely 2021 to 2023 inclusive, Antonio’s
percentage share is 55% for each year.
