I awarded the plaintiff Halime Khatoun Aghdasi
(“Halime”) judgment and dismissed the defendant Vahid Mehdizadeh Asiyaban’s
(“Vahid’s) claims in this consolidated action.
[2]              
This proceeding concerned a dispute over two
properties.
[3]              
The first is a commercial two-story building
located at 188 Deerfield Ave. (the “Deerfield Property”). Halime claims that
this was a jointly held property even though it was registered in the name of
the defendant corporation, 2468692 Ontario Ltd. (the “Corporation” or “246
Ontario”), which is solely owned by Vahid. Halime seeks a resulting trust or a
constructive trust as a remedy for unjust enrichment.
[4]              
The second property is located at 123 Ellis Ave.
(the “Ellis Property”) and was in Halime’s name. Halime claims damages she allegedly
incurred when she sold the Ellis Property, which she says was at a distressed
price because Vahid unreasonably registered a caution (the “Caution”) and
Certificate of Pending Litigation (the “CPL”) against this property. Vahid seeks
a resulting trust or constructive trust as a remedy for unjust enrichment.
[5]              
I awarded Halime judgment. I found that the
Deerfield Property was owned by Halime as to 50 % by way of resulting trust and
that the Ellis Property was also 100 % hers alone and awarded her damages in
respect of the Caution and CPL registered.
[6]              
Halime seeks costs on a full indemnity basis in
the amount of $310,550 plus HST plus $15,279,45 in disbursements or $279,495 in
fees on a substantial indemnity basis and the same disbursements or $201,857.50
on a partial indemnity basis plus the same disbursements.
[7]              
Vahid’s counsel submits that costs should be
fixed in the amount of $160,000 inclusive of HST and disbursements.
[8]              
For the reasons that follow, I award Halime
$279,495 in fees on a substantial indemnity basis plus HST in the amount of
$36,334.35, plus $15,279.45 in disbursements.
[9]              
Pursuant to s. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. C.43, costs are in the discretion of the court. Rule 57 of the Rules sets
out the factors which courts should have regard to when awarding costs. The
overall objective is “to fix an amount that is fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful
party to pay in the particular proceeding, rather than an amount fixed by the
actual costs incurred by the successful litigant”: Zesta Engineering
Ltd. v. Cloutier (2002), 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON CA), 21 C.C.E.L. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
4; Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario
(2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at para. 26; Clarington (Municipality) v.
Blue Circle Canada Inc., 2009 ONCA 722, 100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 52; and G.C.
v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2014 ONSC 1191, at para. 5.
[10]          
The court has the discretion to award substantial indemnity costs, but
such costs are “rare and exceptional” and only warranted where there has been
reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of a party: see DUCA
Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. v. Bozzo, 2010 ONSC 4601, at para. 5; Foulis
v. Robinson (1978), 1978 CanLII 1307 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.); and most recently Mars
Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash & Carry Inc., 2018 ONCA 239, 140 O.R. (3d)
81, at para. 43; Davies v. Clarington (Municipality) et al., 2009 ONCA 722 at
paras 28-31
[11]          
In Net Connect Installation Inc. v. Mobile Zone Inc., 2017 ONCA
766 at paras 8-10, the Court of Appeal noted that instances of fabricated
evidence can be a basis for an elevated costs award.
[12]          
In this case, Vahid’s conduct justifies elevated costs.
[13]          
I found that Vahid had fabricated documents in order to obtain a CPL and
that he enlisted the assistance of another witness who gave testimony in the
CPL proceeding which could not have been truthful given the same witness’
testimony at trial. At trial, Vahid continued to suggest that it was Halime who
may have fabricated these documents which made no sense at all and for which
there was not any evidence.
[14]          
Further, Vahid made serious allegations against Halime and failed to
adduce any evidence in respect of them. He alleged that she had committed
adultery, fabricated criminal charges and fraudulently induced her to sign two
July 20 confirmations.
[15]          
As noted in The Investment Administration Solutions Inc. v. Pro-Financial
Asset Management Inc., 2018 ONSC 2589 at para 14, citing Hamilton v.
Open Window Bakery Ltd., 2004 SCC 9 at para 26 held that elevated costs
were appropriate where:
[16]          
I reject the argument that I should not award substantial indemnity
costs because I made an award of punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.
The conduct here, in filing fabricated evidence with the court is so shocking
and frankly disrespectful to the justice system as a whole, that it justifies
both a punitive damage award and an elevated costs award. Additionally, Vahid
submitted an affidavit from a witness who could not speak English without the
required jurat that the affidavit had been interpreted to the witness. Although
the affidavit as written supported Vahid’s case, when the affidavit was
interpreted to the witness, the witness gave evidence that what had occurred
was actually the opposite of what was in the affidavit that had been interpreted
to the witness.
[17]          
I add here that the reasonable expectation that a party should have if
they submit fabricated documents to the court and this is discovered is that
they will have to pay elevated costs and likely also punitive damages.
Fabrication of evidence is reprehensible, scandalous and outrageous conduct.
[18]          
There is another basis for an elevated costs award, the r. 49 offers
made by Halime as follows:
[19]          
Halime beat her August 29, 2021 offer as she was awarded a 50 % interest
in the Deerfield Property, and $341,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.
[20]          
I have reviewed the Bill of Costs submitted by Halime which is detailed
and provides significant and comprehensive description of the work undertaken
by her counsel. The rates charged are commensurate with the experience of the
lawyers. The costs claimed are proportionate to the amount claimed and the
hours billed are reasonable for a matter that spanned the length of time this
did. This matter was commenced in 2019 and 2020, and the trial lasted 6 days.
The matters at issue were complex. They dealt with complex factual and
credibility issues as well as complex legal issues.
[21]          
The issues were important to Halime and Vahid should have expected that
she would have spent considerable resources to pursue her claim and fight his.
[22]          
Vahid’s Bill of Costs sets out a costs claim on a substantial indemnity
basis of $88,513.07 plus a disbursement amount of $16,615.08.
[23]          
The difference in the Bills of Costs can be explained by the materials
and work that the parties did prior to and at trial. While Halime submitted
comprehensive materials that included a 60-page written affidavit with attached
supporting documents, that traced the flow of funds over 15 years, Vahid filed
only a 10-page bald affidavit copied mostly from his pleading and attaching no
documents.
[24]          
At trial, Halime’s counsel cross examined Vahid for two days which would
have required time for preparation, while Vahid’s counsel cross examined Halime
for only one hour.
[25]          
The extensive work that Halime’s counsel had to do to prepare for the
trial was also increased by Vahid’s denial of almost every fact and allegation
in issue in Halime’s claim, apart from his own identity. While he denied
everything in his pleadings, he admitted everything at trial which demonstrates
the unreasonableness of the denials that he made in his pleadings.
[26]          
I assess that the work that Halime did to prepare for trial was
reasonable and necessary.
[27]          
I also conclude that even though the amount Halime claims is more than
Vahid’s claim for costs, her costs claim was still within his reasonable
expectation. He cannot have thought that the complicated issues involved in
this trial involving the flow of funds over a fifteen-year period, would not
require the amount of preparation that Halime did. It was his choice to do
less, but that does not mean that Halime’s costs claim is not fair and
reasonable.
[28]          
Finally, I reject Vahid’s argument that there was duplication between
counsel for Halime because they did not provide any examples of where this
duplication was for the court to consider.
[29]          
I award Halime $279,495 in fees on a substantial
indemnity basis plus HST in the amount of $36,334.35, plus $15,279.45 in
disbursements all payable within 30 days.
