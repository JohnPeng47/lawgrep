Mr.
Curnew is charged with one count of sexual assault that is alleged to have
occurred between March 1 and July 3, 2020. He was arrested on July 14, 2021.
Mr. Curnew was originally scheduled for a two-week jury trial commencing
October 2, 2023. No judge was available that day or any day that week. The
trial would have finished by October 13, 2023 if it proceeded according to
schedule. From thereon in, defence counsel was largely unavailable despite
multiple dates offered by the Crown and trial office. Mr. Curnew’s trial is
scheduled to start on December 2, 2024. He applies to stay the proceedings pursuant
to s. 11(b) of the Charter due to alleged unreasonable delay of 41
months. He argues that the Jordan ceiling was reached on January 14,
2024, and that all delay but for three weeks is institutional.
[2]              
For the
reasons that follow, I dismissed his application in an oral ruling delivered
September 13, 2024.
[3]              
The
Supreme Court of Canada established in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016]
1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 49 (“Jordan”) that the net delay from when an
accused is charged to the anticipated end of trial cannot exceed 30 months (or
913 days). Net delay is understood as the total time from charge to the
anticipated end of trial, less any delay attributed to or waived by the
accused.
[4]              
In this
case, the parties agree that the total delay between July 14, 2021, when Mr.
Curnew was charged, and December 13, 2024, when his trial is anticipated to
end, is 1249 days or 41 months and 2 days. The defence agrees that defence
delay is 21 days (for the period from August 17-31, 2021 and the week of November
25, 2024). This however does not bring the matter below the Jordan
ceiling. The Crown argues that defence-caused delay amounts to 407 days,
bringing the net delay to 842 days or 27 months and 21 days.
[5]              
If the
Crown’s calculation is correct, there is a presumption of reasonable delay. To
successfully rebut this presumption, Mr. Curnew must demonstrate that this is
one of the clear cases that should be stayed because he took meaningful steps that
demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite his trial and that his matter has
taken markedly longer than it reasonably should have: Jordan, at paras.
82-83, 97, and 101.
[6]              
If the
defence’s position on the cause of delay is correct, the delay falls above the
presumptive 30-month (913-day) ceiling and is presumed unreasonable. To rebut
the presumption, the Crown must establish the presence of exceptional
circumstances.
[7]              
The
defence relies on the recent line of cases where judges of this court took the
bird’s eye view of delay urged in Jordan, at paragraphs 97 and 111, and
stayed matters when a judge was not available on the assigned trial date: R.
v. Downey, 2024 ONSC 2157, 2024 CarswellOnt 6089; R. v. Bowen-Wright,
2024 ONSC 293, 545 C.R.R. (2d) 237, at para. 4 (“Bowen-Wright”); and R.
v. Alli, 2023 ONSC 5829, 2023 CarswellOnt 19405, at para. 28[1]. I would add R. v. Liu, 2024
ONSC 2022, 2024 CarswellOnt 5197 (“Liu”) to that line of cases.
[8]              
The
defence argues that because a judge was not available on the first assigned
trial date, all other delay is institutional. That argument is not persuasive
in this case. First, the parties had a judicial pre-trial with Forestell J.  on
October 5, 2023 to try and reduce the number of trial days to five so that the
parties could use the second week of allocated trial time. The defence believed
they could not proceed in the second week because the Crown failed to call a
witness they were interested in hearing from. This issue does not fall at the
feet of the Crown nor of the institution. I have no evidence that the Crown
undertook to call this witness and that the defence found out at the last
minute that the Crown decided against it. If the defence needed this witness,
it was up to the defence to call her. This also suggests that the defence would
not have been ready to proceed on October 2, 2023 even if a judge had been available,
because they had not subpoenaed the witness.
[9]              
Second,
defence counsel was unavailable for large blocks of time with little to no
explanation. I have no evidence to demonstrate that defence counsel “understood
and had incorporated the proactive, cooperative, and preventative change in
culture that is expected and required in the post-Jordan world”: Liu,
at para. 23. Preventing delay is a shared responsibility.  The sparse
application record does not provide any evidence, other than the email exchange
at Crown Exhibit 11, to take a contextual approach to counsel unavailability,
as described by Schreck J. in Bowen-Wright, at paras. 39-40. The reason
for defence unavailability and any efforts by defence to try and make
themselves, or someone, available, is largely absent.
[10]          
Taking
a bird’s eye view of the little evidence that I do have, I find that the
defence banked on the success of this Charter application and
prioritized other cases after they found out that they could not proceed on
October 2, 2023. This is not the preventive change in culture expected of the
defence nor is block unavailability a free ticket to a stay of proceedings.
[11]          
The
parties agree that this delay is attributable to the defence and is therefore
deductible from the total delay.
[12]          
When
the trial date of October 2, 2023 came around, the court advised that no judge
was available. The parties then attended a judicial pre-trial on October 5,
2023 to attempt to shorten the trial so that it could start on October 9 and
end on October 13, 2023. A law clerk for the defence, who did not attend the
pre-trial but relies on her review of the file, states that the shorter trial
would not have worked because it was the position of the Crown that the defence
had to subpoena the sister of the complainant.
[13]          
I have
no evidence on this issue other than the unreliable evidence of the law clerk.
In theory however, even if true, the Crown is under no obligation to the
defence to call any witnesses. There is no evidence that the Crown misled the
defence about calling the sister as a witness. If the sister was an important
witness for the defence, it is something team Curnew would and should have
sorted out earlier. I do not accept that it was any failure on the Crown’s part
that the trial could not proceed in the second week. The Crown was ready to
proceed with the trial on October 9, 2023. The defence was not. The Crown also
offered the trial to occur in November of 2023, on December 4, 2023, or on January
2, 2024. Defence counsel advised that he was not available until April 8, 2024.
[14]          
For
this period, I also have no evidence to demonstrate that defence counsel fulfilled
his obligation to try and prioritize this trial so that it could proceed as
early as possible. I accept that defence counsel are not expected to hold their
calendars in perpetuity to accommodate trials close to the Jordan
ceiling. Perhaps the November dates were too close to change defence counsel’s
schedule. However, I have no such evidence other than Mr. Zekavica’s general
unavailability until April of 2024. I have no evidence on his circumstances, the
reason for the unavailability, or any options defence counsel considered to try
and be available. Defence delay is delay caused solely or directly by defence
conduct and can include inaction: Jordan, at paras. 64 and 66. I
attribute this entire delay period to the defence.
[15]          
On October
10, 2023 at 1:33 p.m., Mr. Zekavica’s office offered  April 8-23, 2024, June
24-July 12, 2024, and September 30-October 18, 2024 as trial dates. This was in
response to the Crown proposal offering April 22-May 3, May 27-June 7, and June
3-14, 2024.
[16]          
On
October 12, 2023, Mr. Zekavica’s office followed up. Crown counsel was on
vacation but responded on October 12, 2023 to advise that she was attempting to
confirm either the April or fall dates offered. On October 16, 2023, Ms.
Marinosyan wrote that she needed the Crown to confirm one of the offered dates
by noon on October 17, 2023, so that she could schedule other matters. I have
no evidence of the Crown’s response. I do not attribute the inability to
schedule a trial as defence delay because I am satisfied that the defence made
efforts to accommodate a trial.
[17]          
By the
time the parties appeared before Goldstein J. on November 30, 2023, the trial
scheduling office had no availability for a two-week trial between April 8 and
April 23, 2024. This period is not defence delay.
[18]          
When the parties
appeared before Kelly J. on March 28, 2024, Mr. Zekavica had four weeks in May
available starting April 29, 2024. The focus for this period however was to set
a date for Mr. Curnew’s s. 11(b) application, therefore putting the scheduling
of a trial date on hold. Justice Kelly scheduled the s. 11(b) application for
May 17, 2024. Bringing a s. 11(b) application is a legitimate exercise of Mr.
Curnew’s right to make full answer and defence and should not be deducted: Jordan,
at para. 65. This is not defence delay.
[19]          
The Charter application
scheduled for May 17, 2024 did not proceed because the defence failed to obtain
transcripts and file materials as required because they inadvertently forgot to
order transcripts for the hearing. Upon ordering the transcripts, the defence
ran into some Legal Aid problems which they resolved. The parties attended
practice court to reschedule it for August 6, 2024, partly because of counsel
availability and partly because of the 4-6 weeks defence counsel needed to
receive the transcripts.
[20]          
While Mr. Curnew
is entitled to bring a s. 11(b) application, I find that the failure to file
materials causing delay in scheduling the trial amounts to illegitimate defence
conduct or waiver. In April of 2024, the Crown and court were still trying to
find dates to expedite the trial. The Crown had offered trial dates for May 27,
June 3, July 22, and July 29 and August 19, 2024. Mr. Zekavica was not
available for any of those dates, nor do I have evidence on the record of any
attempts to prioritize and accommodate this trial and try to move it up from
December 2, 2024.
[21]          
Mr. Zekavica had
four weeks in May that were available but lost due to the legitimate exercise
of Mr. Curnew’s right to bring his s. 11(b) application. That said, it appears
from discussions with the court in addressing the s. 11(b) application that Mr.
Zekavica believed that his client would succeed. In this context, I infer from
the lack of evidence on defence steps taken that they lost a sense of urgency
in advancing Mr. Curnew’s trial, thinking it would go away. This entire period was
caused by the defence’s unreasonable procedural delay or was an implicit waiver
of delay: R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 2, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at paras. 32-35.
[22]          
In May
of 2024, Mr. Curnew was offered two trial dates: August 19 and September 9, 2024.
Mr. Zekavica was not available until November 25, 2024. In the absence of any
explanation for counsel unavailability other than he had other Superior Court
matters, I agree with the Crown that Mr. Curnew can be taken to have waived this
period of delay or caused it.
[23]          
The
Crown calculates, and the defence agrees, that if all periods noted above are
caused by the defence, the delay is 842 days, putting the case below the
presumptive ceiling. I agree with the Crown that all the above periods of delay
are attributable to the defence, except April 15 to May 17. This removes 32
days from the Crown’s calculus. That said, the defence agrees that it caused
the delay from November 25 to December 2, 2024 and from August 17 to August 31,
2024. The Crown had only included August 19, 2024. That adds 9 days to the
defence delay.
[24]          
With
these adjustments, the final delay calculation is 865 days – a number close to,
but under the presumptive ceiling. It is therefore presumptively reasonable. To
rebut the presumption, Mr. Curnew must show that he took meaningful steps
demonstrating a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings and that his case
has taken markedly longer to proceed to trial than it reasonably should have.
[25]          
As I
indicated earlier, the defence’s only argument was that the lack of a judge on
October 2, 2023 is the reason for all ensuing delay in this trial. They have
not demonstrated by evidence nor argument, a sustained and meaningful defence effort
to expedite Mr. Curnew’s trial.
[26]          
The
onus was on Mr. Curnew to persuade me that his case has taken longer than it
reasonably should have. No such arguments were made. In this case, both the
Crown and the criminal trial office made repeated attempts to prioritize Mr.
Curnew’s trial and were met with block unavailability by defence counsel.
[27]          
This is
not the case to stay due to judge’s unavailability.
