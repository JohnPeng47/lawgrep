[1]            This is my ruling in the matter of R. v. Rebecca Eden, regarding several statements she made to the police.
[2]            The police were investigating a homicide that occurred at the deceased's residence in Fort Erie on June 9th, 2021. As part of the investigation, the police interviewed the deceased's girlfriend. She was initially a person of interest, potentially a suspect, that is Rebecca Eden.
[3]            The police conducted several interviews of the accused Rebecca Eden. Two interviews occurred on June 10th, 2021, shortly after the murder, wherein Rebecca Eden was a person of interest but not a suspect. A subsequent interview occurred in March 2022, after Rebecca Eden was arrested for first degree murder.
[4]            1. Has the Crown proved the voluntariness of Rebecca Eden's statement voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt?
[5]            2. Should the statement be excluded pursuant to Charter violations and pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter?
[6]            On June 9th (and I am going to go into great detail, given that this is a first degree murder charge.): On June 9th, 2021, at about 10:55 p.m., two adult males attended 3815 Mathewson Avenue in Fort Erie. This is the residence of Leonard Aquilina and his son Neil Aquilina.
[7]            The two adult males assaulted Leonard Aquilina. Leonard Aquilina suffered serious injuries, including two large stab wounds. He was pronounced deceased by paramedics at 11:20 p.m. Rebecca Eden was the girlfriend of the deceased. She was not at the residence at 3815 Mathewson but was located after the murder nearby at 313 Ridgeway, the residence of one Rikki Anger.
[8]            I will now go through the evidence of several officers.
[9]            Detective Maguire attended the homicide scene at around one a.m. He received information from Sarah Giroux, the sister of Rebecca Eden and the mother of Kaylynn Riel, that her 14 year old daughter Kaylynn had been at the Mathewson address.
[10]        The police engaged in an emergency search of calls made by Kaylynn on her cell phone. Kaylynn was located at 313 Ridgeway Road, which is a couple of blocks away from 3815 Mathewson. Detective Maguire approached 313 Ridgeway and overheard two females talking. He overheard one or both say, "He's not dead, he's not dead."
[11]        Rikki Anger answered the door. Detective Maguire identified himself as a police officer. He asked if Kaylynn was inside and was told Kaylynn was inside. He asked for Kaylynn to come out as he wished to talk to her. He did a brief interview with Kaylynn in front of his cruiser so that it could be recorded. As Kaylynn was only 14 years old, Maguire instructed her to sit with Officer Pauls and that eventually Family and Children Services would look after her.
[12]        Detective Maguire then told Rebecca Eden he wished to talk to her. Rebecca Eden exited the home at 2:47 a.m. Rebecca Eden didn't wish to go to the police station for an interview. However, she did agree to be interviewed in the front seat of Detective Maguire's cruiser. The interview appears at Tabs 3 and 4 of Exhibit l(a).
[13]        At Tab 3, page 2 of 8, Detective Maguire indicates that Rebecca Eden was not under arrest and could leave at any time. At page 6 of 8, Detective Maguire indicates Rebecca may be charged with murder. She is cautioned and given her rights to counsel. She indicates at that time that she doesn't need to speak to a lawyer.
[14]        In cross-examination, Detective Maguire testified he did that - that is the rights to counsel and cautions because at that time Rebecca was "only a person of interest" but could possibly become a suspect at a later time.
[15]        Constable Pauls and Scobie escorted Kaylynn and Rebecca separately to the police station for a video interview. Constable Pauls and Scobie were instructed not to speak to Kaylynn and Rebecca.
[16]        Kaylynn was interviewed again on video at 4:41 a.m. until 4:57 a.m. Her cell phone was taken from her so that a forensic copy could be taken. From 5:08 am. To 5:55 a.m., Rebecca Eden was interviewed on video at the police station. That video appears at Tab 5 of Exhibit l(a).
[17]        At page 4 of 48, Rebecca Eden is told that she may be charged with murder. She is given rights to counsel and the standard police caution at pages 5 through 7 of 48. Detective Maguire then replays the audiotaped interview of Rebecca Eden taken a couple of hours earlier in the police cruiser. That occurs at page 7 of 48, until page 36 of 48. Rebecca at page 36 agrees that her audio statement is substantially correct.
[18]        At page 41 of 48 to page 47 of 48, Detective Maguire indicates he has been instructed to take her phone and asks for her password, which she provides. Detective Maguire testified he was requested to obtain Rebecca's phone and password. He was further instructed, if necessary, to arrest the accused (that's Rebecca) and seize her phone on an exigency basis.
[19]        In cross-examination, Detective Maguire testified he was advised by his sergeant that Rebecca was not at the address of the homicide scene and that Rebecca was "wanted". Regarding Rebecca Eden, Detective Maguire testified in cross-examination that after he initially spoke with Kaylynn, he told Rebecca that he wanted to speak to her. She told him she didn't want to leave and do a video interview at the police station. He asked her if she would talk in the police car on audio and she said yes. It was a standard practice to tell her, "I want to speak to you and you don't have to speak with me." That standard practice statement does not appear in his notes. There is nothing in his notes regarding the conversation to get Rebecca back to the station. Detective Maguire explained he made no note, as nothing remarkable occurred.
[20]        Detective Dowd asked him to bring her in and was given directions on how to do it. Detective Maguire agreed that 20 minutes earlier, Rebecca Eden agreed to do an audio statement in the car, but didn't want to go to the station. However, Detective Maguire testified that after the audio interview, he again asked her to come to the station and this time she was agreeable. He asked her if she wanted a ride. Detective Dowd had told him to bring Rebecca and Kaylynn in separately. Detective Maguire agreed that he could have recorded these conversations on his cell phone but he didn't do so. He didn't tell Rebecca that she didn't have to go back to the station and didn't have to talk to the police.
[21]        Regarding taking Kaylynn's cell phone and password, Detective Maguire never told Kaylynn she doesn't need to give up her cell phone or password. He didn't ask her if she wanted to speak to a lawyer and didn't tell her he was going to seize her phone regardless.
[22]        Detective Maguire testified he didn't take any steps to ensure that Kaylynn knew she didn't have to give over her phone. Detective Maguire's definition of informed consent is that people have to understand what outcomes could be regarding charges. Detective Maguire intended to return the phone after getting the pass codes, as pass codes would expedite the extraction process and thereby expedite the return of Kaylynnâ€™s phone.
[23]        It was suggested that informed consent meant Kaylynn, in this instance, would understand she didn't have to give up her pass code. Detective Maguire testified he didn't know the proper legal definition of informed consent. His instructions were to seize the phones (that's Kaylynn's and Rebecca's phones) and obtain pass codes if possible.
[24]        Detective Maguire has, in the past, told people they don't have to provide their pass code. He didn't do that with Kaylynn. He has not told people that they could talk to a lawyer before providing a pass code. He did, however, allow Kaylynn to speak to a responsible adult.
[25]        At the outset of the interview he did not indicate he would be asking for the phone and pass code. If Kaylynn had refused to hand over her phone, he would have arrested her for obstruct police. Detective Maguire agreed that she was not free to leave until she provided the phone. His definition of detention is what a person knows about whether they can leave or not.
[26]        Regarding Rebecca Eden and her statement at Tab 5 of Exhibit l(a), at page 3, she was referred to the caution in her audio recording. She was told at pages 4 through 5 she could be charged with murder. Detective Maguire testified that Rebecca was a person of interest at that time, but there was a potential of her later becoming a suspect. She was given the standard caution and her rights to counsel at page 5. She indicated she understood. She indicated she understood her right to counsel and had nothing to hide. However, when asked if she wanted to speak to counsel she never said yes or no to the question of wishing to contact counsel.
[27]        The officer testified he has never had anyone say they have nothing to hide and then want to talk to a lawyer. Earlier, in the audio statement at page 6 of 8, at Tab 3, she said she didn't want to speak to a lawyer. That was also replayed in the video statement at page 13 of Tab 5, when the audio statement was being replayed.
[28]        Detective Maguire stated his plan before the video started was to seize Rebecca's phone. Rebecca would not be allowed to leave the police station until he seized her phone. It was suggested that was a detention. Detective Maguire did not have a warrant for either Kaylynn or Rebecca's phones. At page 44 of Tab 5, Detective Maguire told Rebecca they were going to download all relevant information. His understanding was that the entire phone would be downloaded and after obtaining a warrant, the police would look at the relevant time period and calls and messages that occurred at that time.
[29]        Detective Maguire agreed that he had no evidence of commission of the offence that may be on the phone. This was to be a download of the phone in exigent circumstances, according to Detective Maguire. At page 43 of Tab 5 he asked for Rebecca's password. He took no steps to obtain an informed consent for the password. Police software can enter a phone with or without a password.
[30]        Dealing next with Constable Pauls. Detective Pauls escorted Rebecca to the station on June 10th, at 3:38 a.m., as per Detective Maguire's instructions. Rebecca Eden sat in the front seat and was not restrained. No important conversation occurred but Constable Pauls couldn't recall any details of any conversations if that occurred. All he knew is that she, Rebecca Eden, was going to speak to the detectives. He was not told Rebecca Eden was a suspect. If she was, he would have transported her in the back of his police cruiser.
[31]        In cross-examination, Officer Pauls indicated when Kaylynn came out someone sat her at the back of the cruiser with the door open. He was to keep her there until detectives spoke to her. He doesn't recall telling Kaylynn she didn't have to stay at the cruiser and she didn't have to speak to the police. If she tried to leave, he would have notified someone she was leaving.
[32]        Officer Pauls could not recall who asked him to transport Rebecca Eden to the police station. That was done at 3:38 a.m. He was not told that she was arrested or detained.  He was not told that she was a person of interest or a possible witness. He was only told to transport her. She was not under arrest or detention. He never told her she didn't have to talk to the police officers and didn't tell her she didn't have to go to the police station. Detective Maguire didn't give him any information regarding Rebecca Eden.
[33]        Kelly Gerrie was the next witness. Kelly Gerrie is a Niagara Police Service officer. On March 10th, 2022, she was advised that police were planning to arrest Rebecca Eden for the homicide that occurred at Mathewson on June 9th, 2021. That arrest was to take place at 442 Cambridge West.
[34]        Sergeant Fletcher and Dowd were doing the arresting. Constable Gerrie's role was to audio tape the arrest. At 4:53 p.m., the homeowner arrived at 442 Cambridge West. The Homeowner phoned Rebecca Eden. Rebecca Eden arrived at 442 Cambridge at 5:03 p.m. The arrest events are recorded at Tab 6, Exhibit l(c).
[35]        Rebecca Eden was arrested for first degree murder. She was cautioned and given her rights to counsel and stated she understood (See pages 5 and 11). At page 5, Rebecca Eden stated she wished to speak to a lawyer. Rebecca Eden was transported to the station. From 6:18 to 6:37 p.m. Rebecca Eden spoke to duty counsel. Officer Gerrie noticed alcohol on Eden's breath but Officer Gerrie expressed the opinion that Rebecca was not intoxicated.
[36]        Detective Sergeant Dowd was the next witness. On June 9th, 2021 at 11 p.m. Detective Sergeant Dowd received a call from Detective Fletcher regarding a stabbing. At 11:22 p.m. he got a call that the victim was now deceased. Detective Sergeant Dowd started paging other members of the team. He had no personal involvement with Rebecca Eden until her arrest on March 10th, 2022, as outlined in Exhibit 1 (c).
[37]        In cross-examination Detective Sergeant Dowd testified he was directing people on June 9th and 10th and giving instructions until Detective Atkinson could come in and take over. The police were concerned about Kaylynn's safety. Pursuant to Kaylynn's phone pinging a nearby address, Officer Maguire was tasked with finding Kaylynn. Officer Maguire was instructed to find Kaylynn and get her to a place of safety.
[38]        Shortly after 2:37 a.m., but before 3:12 a.m., Detective Maguire reported that he is on-scene and Kaylynn is there. Sometime between 2:38 a.m. and 2:47 a.m., Detective Maguire advises he spoke to Kaylynn and advised that he is going to interview Rebecca Eden, who was also on-scene.
[39]        The police were aware that Eden had an argument earlier with the deceased at their home, but she was not at the home at the time of the stabbing. Accordingly the police wanted a statement from Rebecca Eden. It was suggested that Officer Maguire was able to get an audio statement from Rebecca from 2:45 a.m. to 3:09 a.m. Detective Maguire called Detective Sergeant Dowd shortly after at 3:12 a.m., and Maguire advised Rebecca did not want to do a video statement but did do an audio statement. Normally a video statement is taken at the police station. Detective Sergeant Dowd did not instruct Maguire to take a video statement from Rebecca. He didn't ask Detective Maguire to get Rebecca to change her mind and do a video statement.
[40]        At 3:29 a.m., Detective Maguire advised he is arranging rides for Kaylynn and for Rebecca Eden, who now said she will come in for a video, that is 3:29 a.m. Detective Maguire did this of his own accord. Detective Sergeant Dowd is at Number 5 District and Detective Atkinson shows up at 4:08 a.m. There was a team meeting at 4:43 a.m. Detective Maguire was not there as he started Kaylynn's interview at 4:41 a.m.
[41]        Detective Maguire has a note that at 4:25 a.m. he met with Inspector Leigh, Detective Dowd, Detective Sergeant Magistrale and Detective Atkinson. Maguire noted that someone directed him not to caution Kaylynn but to seize her cell phone. Sergeant Detective Dowd testified he was there but he doesn't recall that direction. Detective Sergeant Dowd had no discussions with Maguire about seizures of cell phones, but was aware it happened. He thinks Detective Atkinson provided those instructions sometime between 4:25 and 4:41 a.m. He believes that occurred at 4:33 a.m. Maguire was directed to speak to Kaylynn but not to caution her, but was to take her phone.
[42]        Detective Michael Fletcher was the next witness. His first contact with Rebecca Eden was assisting in her arrest and to facilitate Rebecca Eden's request to call counsel. He called the duty counsel at the station. Rebecca Eden spoke to duty counsel I. Dejesus at 6:15 p.m. to 6:37 p.m.  He also called counsel Tom Jamieson but got no answer.
[43]        On June 9th, 2021, Detective Atkinson was at the police college, but he was paged at 12:45 a.m. on June 10th, 2021, to assist in a murder investigation. At 4 a.m. he attended Number 5 District and met with Staff Sergeant Magistrale and Detective Dowd and was assigned as the lead investigator. He was provided details that the victim Leonard Aquilina was stabbed at 3815 Mathewson. The victim lived there with his son Neil and his girlfriend Rebecca Eden. Kaylynn Riel was also associated with that address.
[44]        Earlier in the evening, the victim had an argument with Rebecca Eden. Two suspects had forced their way into the residence with weapons and stabbed the victim. Neil did not want to give a statement. There were concerns regarding 14 year old Kaylynn, who was a witness to the earlier incident between the victim and Rebecca Eden. The police located Kaylynn at 313 Ridgeway. Rebecca Eden was also there. Detective Atkinson knew that Detective Maguire had Rebecca Eden and Kaylynn transported to the station for statements.
[45]        Detective Atkinson gave directions to Detective Maguire to get a pure version statement from Kaylynn. Kaylynn was not to be cautioned, as she was not a suspect. Detective Atkinson directed that Kaylynn's cell phone be seized due to exigent circumstances. It was not practicable to get her phone seized pursuant to a warrant. Messages can be deleted and he didn't want that to happen.
[46]        Similar directions were given for Rebecca Eden, however, she was to be cautioned regarding possible murder charges. Her phone was to be seized due to exigent circumstances. Her statement was to be voluntary and she could leave at any time. However, if Rebecca refused to provide her phone, she was to be detained and the phone seized, and then she was to be released unconditionally.
[47]        On June 13 and 14, Detective Atkinson spoke to Detective Maguire. Detective Maguire was to tell Rebecca Eden that charges had been laid, but extractions were not done yet and the phone couldn't be returned. Detective Atkinson directed Rebecca Eden be arrested on March 10th for first degree murder.
[48]        On March 11th at 7:35 a.m., at page 3 of the audio at Tab 7, Rebecca confirmed that she spoke to duty counsel DeJesus but she also wanted to speak to Tom Jamieson. Detective Atkinson made repeated attempts to contact Jamieson. At 9:39 a.m., Rebecca spoke to another lawyer that she wanted to speak to and that's Michael Peterson. That call was completed at 9:48 a.m. and then Rebecca was able to speak to Tom Jamieson, and that call lasted until 9:51 a.m.
[49]        The police were then satisfied that Rebecca Eden had spoken to her lawyer of choice. Rebecca was arrested on March 10th but not interviewed until 10:24 a.m. on March 11th. There were two reasons for the delay. One, a second person was in custody on March 10th and two, there was concern regarding alcohol on Rebecca's breath on March 10th; although there were no concerns regarding her ability to understand what was occurring.
[50]        Regarding the audio and video statements made upon the accused's arrest for first degree murder on March 11th, 2022, transcribed at Tab 8 of the Crown's materials, I make the following findings:
[51]        On June 10th at 12:11 p.m., Andrew Blais was arrested for second degree murder. On June 11th, the next day, Tristan Skelton was arrested for murder. In their interviews, the accused stated they were at 331 Ridgeway before and after the murder. Blais and Shelton's statements implicated Rebecca Eden in the murder, i.e. she directed Blais and Skelton to beat Len up.
[52]        At a team meeting on June 12th at 10:07 a.m., the Saturday after the murder, it was determined then that Rebecca Eden was a suspect, but there was not enough evidence to charge her with murder at that time. The police held Rebecca's phone but did not do any searches until a search warrant issued about a week after the seizure. Detective Atkinson was extensively cross-examined by defence counsel. I am not going to go over all the cross-examination but refer to some highlights.
[53]   Two years after Strachan, in R v. Brydges, ... Lamer J. held that the connection between the Charter breach and the evidence should be looked at broadly: " ... s. 24(2) is implicated as long as a Charter violation occurred in the course of obtaining the evidence".
[54]   Then, in 2004, in R. v. Plaha at para. 45, Doherty J.A. added "contextual" to the list of connections that could satisfy the "obtained in a manner" requirement, and he succinctly summarized the Supreme Court's approach:
[55] Four years later in R. v. Wittwer, (2008] 2008 SCC 33 (CanLII), 2 S.C.R. 235, (2008] S.C.J. No. 33, 2008 sec 33, at para. 21, Fish J., for a unanimous court, adopted Doherty J.A.'s formulation in Plaha (which I have just referred) and stressed that the court's approach to the "obtained in a manner" requirement should be both "purposive" and "generous".
[56]   A generous approach to the "obtained in a manner" requirement makes good sense because this requirement is just the gateway to the focus of s. 24(2) -- whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. And, as the trial judge in the appeal before us acknowledged, the addition of "contextual" to "causal" and "temporal" as connections "loosened" the "obtained in a manner" requirement.
[57]   Despite the generous approach to "obtained in a manner", the Supreme Court has never expressly said that the requirement can be met by a Charter breach that occurred after the discovery of the evidence sought to be excluded. And several Supreme Court decisions since Strachan have presumed the Charter breach occurred before the discovery of the evidence.
[58]   But the court's recent decision in R v. Mian, ... suggests that it may be inclined to take account of Charter breaches occurring after the discovery of the evidence in an appropriate case. Mian was decided after the trial of the case before us, and therefore the trial judge did not have the benefit of it when he wrote his reasons.
