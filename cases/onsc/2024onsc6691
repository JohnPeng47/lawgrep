In support of her application for a declaration
that a codicil made by her deceased father that appoints the respondent as the
sole estate trustee is invalid, and her application to remove the respondent as
estate trustee, the applicant brings this motion for an order requiring the production
of medical records, solicitor records and police records and for leave to
examine the deceased’s solicitors pursuant to Rule 31.10 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure.
[2]              
Donato Valerio died on January 16, 2023
(“Donato). He was predeceased by his wife Filomena Valerio (“Filomena”). Donato
and Filomena were survived by two children: Mary Grace (“Mary”) and Pasqualino
(“Pat”). I refer to the parties and their parents by their first names,
for convenience.
[3]              
The only asset of significant value in Donato’s
Estate is a ten-acre property in Markham, Ontario where Donato and Filomena
resided. (“Markham Property”).
[4]              
As will be further explained below, a fraud
action was commenced by a former business partner against Pat and his spouse Rosanna
alleging that they had misappropriate $1.5 million from the company. Both Pat’s
parents and Rosanna’s parents were named as defendants. They retained Paul
Bigioni to defend this action. The action settled in about 2008.
[5]              
Donato made a Will dated January 28, 2009, that
named Filomena as the Estate Trustee of his Estate and which named Mary and Pat
as alternate co-estate trustees. The residue of Donato’s Estate was to be left
to Filomena but, if she did not survive him by thirty days, then the residue of
Donato’s estate would be divided equally between Pat and Mary. (“2009 Will”). The
2009 Will was drafted by Mr. Bigioni.
[6]              
About ten years later, on March 5, 2019, Donato
executed a codicil to provide that the issue of Pat and Mary would inherit
their respective share of his Estate should either of them fail to survive him
for thirty days. (“2019 Codicil”)
[7]              
At the same time, Donato executed a continuing
power of attorney for property that appointed Filomena, Pat and Mary as his
attorneys. It provides that any decision that involves the management of
property with a value greater than $25,000 requires the approval of a majority
of his attorneys. As well, he executed a power of attorney for personal care
that appointed Filomena, Pat and Mary as his attorneys.
[8]              
These instruments were prepared by Keith
Nichols.
[9]              
Joselie Paglinawan Alcayde (“Joselie”) was
Filomena and Donato’s personal support worker from February 1, 2020 until
Donato’s death in January 2023. She worked eight hours a day from Monday to
Friday. On the weekends, Fe Celestial, took her place. Joselie states that
Donato was a heavy drinker and that he suffered from heart issues, colon cancer
and COVID-19 which eventually took his life. She states that Mary was present
daily until Filomena’s death on July 27, 2020, and then Pat took over to help
Donato with his financial and other needs. Joselie observed Pat speaking
forcefully to Donato. She states that Donato once told her that he was afraid
of upsetting Pat. She also states that Pat tried to keep Mary away from Donato.
[10]          
Fe Celestial (“Fe”) states that she worked for
Donato from June 2022 until his death in January 2023. She worked weekends from
8 am to 7 pm. Fe states that Pat, his wife and his daughter, were very good to
her and Donato. They brought food for him and tidied up his home. Pat took care
of the maintenance of Donato’s home both inside and outside. Fe never saw Pat
raise his voice to Donato or otherwise intimidate him. Donato told Fe that
Mary’s husband was not “a good guy”. He also told her that he was not
dying of cancer but rather from the heartbreak because neither his children nor
his grandchildren got along.
[11]          
On July 27, 2022, Donato executed a power of
attorney for property and a power of attorney for personal care (“the 2022
POAs”) both of which appointed Pat as the sole attorney. This instrument was
prepared by Lawrence Sutton.
[12]          
On November 29, 2022, Donato signed a second
codicil that was prepared by Mr. Sutton (“2022 Codicil”). It does not change
the equal division of the residue of the Estate between Mary and Pat pursuant
to the terms of the 209 Will. However, it removes Mary as co-estate trustee and
appoints Pat as the sole estate trustee, with Mary as the alternate. It also
makes a gift of $50,000.00 to one of Donato’s caregivers, Joselie Alcayde.
(“2022 Codicil”).
[13]          
The applicant submits that Pat’s appointment as
the sole estate trustee in the 2022 Codicil makes no sense as, in her view,
everything up to that point indicated that Donato did not trust Pat. However, the
so-called “U-turn” in Donato’s trust in his son, if there was any such change,
may be explained, at least in part, by the events that occurred in Donato’s
home involving the police in the several months prior to the making of the
Codicil that are described near the end of this Endorsement.
[14]          
Mr. Sutton’s records in respect of the 2022 POAs
and the 2022 Codicil were produced pursuant to the 2023 Consent Order described
below. His records state:
[15]          
Donato died on January 16, 2023.
[16]          
In March 2023, Mary commenced this application
for, amongst other things, an order for directions regarding the validity of
the 2022 Codicil on grounds of lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence,
lack of knowledge and approval and the presence of suspicious circumstances.
[17]          
On May 30, 2023, a consent Order was granted in
respect of various matters including the production of Donato’s medical and
financial records from May 1, 2022, onwards as well as certain legal records pertaining
to Donato (“2023 Consent Order”). It states, in part, as follows:
[18]          
Mary seeks the following Order:
[19]          
This motion for directions is brought pursuant
to Rule 75.06 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Myers J. in Seepa v.
Seepa, 2017 ONSC 5368, at para. 39, provided the following guidance in
respect of the exercise of the court’s discretion in making an order for
directions under Rule 75.06(3):
[20]          
The 2022 Codicil was executed on November 29,
2022. Mary has been provided with Donato’s medical records for about a seven-month
period prior to the making of the 2022 Codicil. She asks that Donato’s medical
records going back to December 1, 2019, be produced for the following reasons:
[21]          
Mary asserts that Donato suffered from
“diminished capacity” at the time that he executed the 2002 Codicil. However, that
assertion is not supported by the medical records or legal records that have
been produced. To borrow again from Myers J. in Seepa, at para. 28, there
is something innately offensive about the idea that a disgruntled family member
“… can simply romp through a testator’s most private legal and health
information fishing for evidence on making the most meagre of allegations of
impropriety on no real evidence.” I dismiss Mary’s motion for the production of
additional medical records.
[22]          
Mary seeks the disclosure of solicitor client
privileged documents from three legal files.
[23]          
Solicitor client privilege is not engaged when
evidence of the deceased’s solicitor is sought in will cases in respect of
matters “dealing with the execution, tenor or validity of wills” as such
evidence furthers the interests of the deceased by allowing evidence to be
admitted in order to ascertain the deceased’s true intentions: Goodman
Estate v. Geffen, 1991 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 64; Sidney N.
Lederman, Alan W. Bryant & Hamish C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman &
Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada, 6th ed. (Toronto, LexisNexis, 2022),
at §14.151.
[24]          
In Ontario (Attorney General) v. Ballard
Estate, 1994 CanLII 7513 (ON SC), [1994] O.J. No. 2281, 20 O.R. (3d) 350, Lederman J. stated:
[25]          
An action for $1.5 million in damages was
commenced in 2006 by Urban Electrical Contractors and Pat’s former business
partners, in which it was alleged that Pat, in concert with his wife Rosanna,
had misappropriated money and labour the company in order to pay for the
construction of their home. Donato, Filomena and Rosanna’s parents, Antonio
Gugliemi and Maria Gugliemi, were also named as defendants.
[26]          
Amongst other things, the claim alleged that
Donato, Filomena, Antonio and Maria unlawfully conspired with each other to
receive monetary benefits from Urban Electrical and that they knowingly and improperly
charged personal expenses to Urban’s account. Donato, Filomena, Antonio and
Maria jointly retained Paul Bigioni and Bigioni LLP to represent defend them.
[27]          
Mary states that this action was settled in 2008
or 2009 by way of a payment of $1,500,000.00 which resulted in Pat and Rossana
selling their home to make this payment. Mary states:
[28]          
Antonio states that he did not observe Donato or
Filomena being upset with Pat’s conduct as a result of the action and does not
believe that they were upset with him. Antonio states that after the action was
settled, Pat continued to visit Donato and Filomena frequently and assisted
them when they were sick and continued to help them with the upkeep of their
home.
[29]          
The Bigioni file related to the 2006 fraud
action was settled about 13 years before the impugned 2022 Codicil.  I do not
see how the circumstances surrounding the 2006 fraud action, including its
settlement, have any relevance to the validity of the 2022 Codicil. While as
noted in Roe v. Roe, 2024 ONCA 179, at para. 18, a claim of undue
influence requires an understanding of the nature of the relationship between
the alleged influencer and the deceased, there is no basis for finding that
these records would have relevant information other than Mary’s unsupported
evidence. I find that it would not be in the interests of justice to grant this
production order.
[30]          
Mary further submits that the Bigioni file
related to the 2006 Fraud Action is relevant to her application to remove Pat
as the estate trustee. However, an estate trustee’s past misconduct will only
justify removal if such misconduct is likely to continue in order to protect
the estate assets and the interests of the beneficiaries: Virk v. Brar,
2014 ONSC 4611, at para. 48.
[31]          
Further, Angelo and Maria state that they
understood that any communication between themselves and Mr. Bigioni were
confidential and expected that they would remain confidential. They oppose the
disclose of any privileged documents in Mr. Bigioni’s possession. Counsel for
Mary has offered to have redacted any information in Mr. Bigioni’s file that
pertains to Antonio and Maria before it is produced to the parties. Nevertheless,
Antonio objects to the disclosure of his solicitor-client records held by Mr.
Bigioni as he believes that the redaction of his and Maria’s personal
information will be sufficient to protect their privileged relationship with
Mr. Bigioni.
[32]          
In R. v. Dunbar, 1982 CanLII 3324 (ON CA), [1982] O.J. No. 581,
Martin, J.A. stated at para. 83:
[33]          
An exception to this principle exists when
spouses jointly retain a solicitor to prepare their wills. In such cases, the
surviving spouse implicitly waives solicitor client privilege when the
surviving spouse attends with her spouse to give instructions to the solicitor: Durand v. Durand, 2015 MBQB 132, at para. 25; Marder v. Geller, 2024 ONSC
4806, at para. 60. However, this exception has no application on these facts
given that the joint retainer was not in respect of estate planning but rather
the defence of a civil action.
[34]          
In my view, the interests of justice make it
more important to protect solicitor client privilege than to ascertain the
solicitor’s evidence regarding the defence of the 2006 Fraud Action, including
any views expressed by Donato to Mr. Bigioni regarding Pat, as it could not
have been reasonably anticipated that Antonio and Maria’s privilege would be
waived in such circumstances.
[35]          
Mary seeks Mr. Bigioni’s files related to Donato
and Filomena’s estate planning which occurred in 2009 as well as Mr. Nichols’
estate planning file from 2019.
[36]          
The 2009 Will appointed Filomena as the estate
trustee and named the parties as alternate co-estate trustees. The 2009 Will is
not challenged.  I do not see the relevance of Mr. Bigioni’s file related to
the preparation of the 2009 Will to the validity of the 2022 Codicil.
[37]          
Mary also seeks Mr. Nichols’ files related to
Donato and Filomena’s estate planning file related to the 2019 Codicil and the
2019 POAs. Neither of these documents are challenged. Mary submits that the
2019 POA includes a $25,000.00 limit, unless a majority of the attorneys
otherwise agree, that was imposed by Donato at her request given her concerns
with Pat’s trustworthiness. I note that the limit applies to both Mary and Pat.
In any event, I find that Mr. Nichols’ file for the 2019 Codicil and 2019
POAs should be produced in order to ascertain the circumstances that existed at
that time, only three years before the 2022 Codicil, and the impetus for Donato
and Filomena’s amendment to the POA as it relates to the $25,000.00 trigger for
requiring majority rule.
[38]          
Further, pursuant to Rule 31.10, leave is
granted to examine Mr. Sutton and Mr. Nichols in respect of their solicitor
files that have been produced or that have been ordered to be produced.
[39]          
Mary states that Pat’s behaviour led to police being called
to Donato’s home on April 6, May 6, May 8 and July 20, 2022. Mary has obtained
a redacted copy of the related police reports pursuant to a request made under the
Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56. Mary states that:
[40]          
These reports document a considerable amount of
inappropriate behaviour particularly of Mary’s husband. Mary relies on Rule 31.10
of the Rules of Civil Procedure which has a two-part test for the
purpose of obtaining a full copy of the reports.  Given that the parties
previously agreed that these reports should be released, I see no reason why the
requested order for a full copy of the reports, subject to certain limitations
that have been requested by York Region Police, should not be granted in an
effort to obtain a less redacted copy of the reports.
[41]          
The applicant’s motion is granted in part. The
parties are encouraged to resolve the issue of costs failing which the
respondent and non-parties shall deliver their costs submission within ten days
and the applicant shall deliver her costs submissions within twenty days. Each
costs submission shall be no more than three pages in length exclusive of an outline
of costs and any offers to settle.
