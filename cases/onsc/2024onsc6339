This is the applicant father’s motion for
temporary child support from the respondent mother for the parties’ son,
commencing September 1, 2024. Specifically, the father seeks an order requiring
the mother to pay table child support of $2,379 a month based on an imputed
income of $300,000 a year for her in accordance with the Child Support
Guidelines, O. Re. 391/97 (“CSG”). He also seeks an order that the
mother pay 59% of the child’s s.7 expenses which includes swimming lessons,
summer camps, school expenses such a field trips and meal programs, a math
tutoring game, non-insured medical and dental expenses.
[2]              
The mother sought an adjournment of today’s
motion and asked the court to hear the father’s child support motion after her
motion for expanded parenting time is heard on December 3, 2024.
[3]              
This is the mother’s second attempt to adjourn
the father’s child support motion. The father’s child support motion materials
were served on the mother on September 27, 2024. The mother did not file
responding materials for the father’s child support motion. This is even though
the mother has known since October 8, 2024, that the father’s child support
motion was returnable today.
[4]              
The request for an adjourned was denied.
[5]              
The issue for me to determine is whether the
mother should be ordered to pay temporary child support to the father for their
son, who resides primarily with the father and if so, whether she should be
imputed with an income of $300,000 as proposed by the father, or in some other
amount?
[6]              
By way of background, the parties separated on
August 21, 2018. They have one child, D., who is 7 years old. He is in Grade 2.
[7]              
The father has re-partnered and has a daughter
with his wife, D.’s half-sister.
[8]              
The parties were engaged in high conflict
litigation after they separated. They ultimately reached a consent which was
incorporated into the Final order of Czutrin, J, dated March 10, 2021 (“Final
Consent Order”).
[9]              
The Final Consent Order sets out that the parties
are to have equal parenting time with D. on an alternating, 2-2-3 schedule
during the school year and an equal division of holiday time; the parties are
to live within 10 km of each other and not relocate with D. outside of the GTA
without consent; the father was to pay the mother child support until December
2020, following which, no table child support would be paid given that the
equal time sharing schedule; the father was to be solely responsible for D.’s
s.7 expenses for 3 years ending July 27, 2023, after which the parties were to
share his s.7 expenses proportionately.
[10]          
The parties followed the parenting schedule for
a number of years.
[11]          
On November 15, 2023, the mother advised the
father that she intended to move to Combermere, Ontario, 300 km away from D.’s
school, effective December 1, 2023. She wanted D. to move with her but the
father would not consent.
[12]          
On December 13, 2023, the father brought a
Motion to Change to amend the parenting schedule since the mother was moving.
The mother brought her own Motion to Change, seeking primary residence of D.,
sole decision-making responsibility and to set aside the child support waiver
provided for in the Final Consent Order.
[13]          
The mother moved to Combermere and between March
15, 2024 and September 15, 2024, the parties followed a parenting schedule
where D. resided with the mother from Friday, after school to Sunday, at 7:00
p.m. on alternate weekends; during the summer months, from Thursdays to Sundays
on alternate weekends; and for the remainder of the time, D. resided with the
father primarily.
[14]          
The mother overheld D. after her weekend from
September 15, 2024 to October 4, 2024, when she was ordered to return D. to the
father in Toronto.
[15]          
She claims to have overheld him because D. told
her that he was abused in the father’s care. The mother reported the disclosure
to the Highland Shores Children’s Aid Society.
[16]          
The father brought an urgent motion for the
return of the child which he served on the mother on September 17, 2024. The
parties were directed to attend a TBST court on September 23, 2024, at which
time Nakonechny, J. set the father’s motion for the return of the child for
October 3, 2024. Nakonechny, J. also ordered the father’s motion for child
support to be returnable on October 8, 2024.
[17]          
After the TBST court, the mother brought an ex
parte motion in the Pembroke branch of this court and sought a restraining
order against the father and sought primary residence of the child. She did not
disclose the Endorsement of Nakonechny, J., dated September 23, 2023 to the
court in Pembroke.
[18]          
Hooper, J. of the Pembroke court made the
restraining order on a temporary basis to be reviewed by this court.
[19]          
On October 4, 2024, Des Rosiers, J. made an
order vacating Hooper, J.’s order and granted an order for the mother to return
the child to Toronto by October 4, 2024.
[20]          
The mother has now moved back to Toronto and
seeks to return to the equal time-sharing parenting schedule that was in place
before she moved.
[21]          
It is agreed that the parties have engaged Shely
Polak to conduct an updated s.30 parenting assessment. The father completed his
intake forms and undertook to pay Shely Polak’s retainer by the end of October
8, 2024. The father’s position is that while the s.30 assessment process is
underway, neither party is to bring a motion to change the parenting schedule.
The mother’s position is that she brought her motion for expanded parenting
time before the parties re-engaged Shely Polak. That motion, again, is
returnable before the court on December 3, 2024.
[22]          
In accordance with Nakonechny, J.’s Order dated
September 23, 2024, the father’s motion for a travel consent and for child
support was returnable before the court on October 8th, 2024. On
that day, the mother sought an adjournment of the father’s motion advising the
court that she was about to obtain a legal aid certificate. She also indicated
that she intended to bring a motion to expand her parenting time. Accordingly,
on October 8, 2024, I made the following order:
[23]          
The parties advised the court today that the
case conference regarding the child’s parenting schedule took place before Shin
Doi, J. on October 24, 2024, at which time the mother’s motion for expanded
parenting time was scheduled for December 3, 2024.  The parties were not able
to reach an agreement on D.’s parenting schedule.
[24]          
Courts have the jurisdiction to order child
support pursuant to the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the “Family
Law Act”) and the CSG.
[25]          
In DBS v SRG, 2006 SCC 37, at para. 104,
and Michael v Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, at para. 10, the Supreme Court of
Canada emphasized the importance of child support, including the following
principles:
[26]          
Given that D. has been residing in the father’s
primary care since March 2024, I find that the mother is obliged to pay the
father child support for the child in accordance with her income as per the CSG.
[27]          
The father seeks a temporary order for child
support commencing September 1, 2024.
[28]          
He argues that the mother’s income should be
imputed at $300,000 a year.
[29]          
Section 19 of the CSG permits the court
to impute such an amount of income as it considers appropriate in the
circumstances.
[30]          
The leading case on imputing income is Drygala
v. Pauli, 2002 CanLII 41868 (ONCA).  Drygala stands for the
following principles:
[31]          
Section 19 of the CSG includes
circumstances where the parent has failed to provide income information when
under a technical obligation to do so; Hong v. Nguyen, 2018 ONSC 7357,
at para. 14.
[32]          
In Graham v Bruto, 2008 ONCA 260, the
Ontario Court of Appeal inferred that the failure of the payor to properly
disclose mitigates the obligation of the recipient to provide an evidentiary
basis to impute income; at para. 4.
[33]          
Where a party fails to provide full financial
disclosure relating to their income, the court is entitled to draw an adverse
inference and to impute income to them.
[34]          
The person seeking to impute income to a party
has the initial onus to establish an evidentiary basis to support that claim.
However, such an onus does not relieve the prospective payor from providing
full and complete financial disclosure, so as to ensure the court has complete
information. As there are many circumstances in which a party seeking to impute
income will not have full financial knowledge or information, courts generally
do not set the threshold too high as regards the existence of appropriate
circumstances where imputation of income can be considered. Once the party
seeking to impute income provides satisfactory evidence suggesting a prima
facie case for the imputation of income, the onus shifts to the other party
to satisfy the court as to his/her income level; See Babzadeh-Olari v. Villares-Reyes,
2021 ONSC 3558, at para.86, and McKenna v. McKenna, 2015 ONSC 3309.
[35]          
As stated above, the mother failed to file
responding motion material to the father’s motion for child support. This is
despite the fact that the mother was served with the father’s materials on
September 27, 2024, and has had more than sufficient time to do so. Further,
the mother’s failure to file an updated sworn financial statement is a
violation of her obligations to do so under the Family Law Rules. Moreover,
the mother was ordered to provide financial disclosure to the father by Sharma,
J., at a case conference on July 8, 2024 and she has failed to provide a
response to the father’s request for information.
[36]          
The only evidence on record before the court as
to the mother’s income is from her sworn financial statement, sworn on February
20, 2024, which she filed in support of her Motion to Change.
[37]          
This financial statement lists the mother’s current
income at that time as $2,856 a year in 2024.
[38]          
 The evidence on which I can rely to impute
income to the mother is as follows:
[39]          
In answer to a number of questions from the
court, the mother advised the court as follows:
[40]          
These statements made by the mother in answers
to questions from the court were not made by her under oath and are not part of
the formal record. If her statements regarding her property being in
foreclosure are accurate, then once the property is sold, the mother’s monthly
budget would be reduced by $7,400 a month, or a further $88,800 a year,
reducing her annual budget to $133,500.
[41]          
As stated in Bak v. Dobell, 2007 ONCA 304
(CanLIII), “a payor's lifestyle often will be relevant to whether a court may
impute income under s. 19(1) of the Guidelines. For example, it may be apparent
from lifestyle that a payor is receiving undeclared income because he or she
has historically worked, lives comfortably with the usual trappings, and yet
declares minimal income for tax or child support purposes. In such a case, the
recipient who calls evidence of the payor's lifestyle will ask the court to
draw the reasonable inference that the payor must have a greater income than he
or she has disclosed.”
[42]          
 Needless to say, the quality of financial information from the
mother at this stage is not ideal. There are many questions that remain
outstanding to determine the mother’s income.
[43]          
 At the motion stage, there is an element of “rough justice” that the Court must partake in to
ascertain an income of the mother for child support purposes: both the
applicant and respondent for support purposes:
Seifi v. Hanji, 2021 ONSC 3419 (CanLII).
[44]          
Given the evidence on the record, I am not
prepared to impute the mother with an annual income of $300,000. I have clear
evidence of her ability to earn at least $100,000 a year based on her 2021 and
2022 Notices of Assessment. If her budget is reduced by the depletion of her
RRSP which she claims was a one-time event which occurred in 2023 and by the
mortgage payments which should no longer be an expense once her property is
sold, the lifestyle analysis would result in her having to earn a gross income
less than the $300,000 a year proposed by the father.
[45]          
Considering her past Notices of Assessment, the
budget listed in her sworn financial statement, and in drawing an adverse
inference against her failure to produce income disclosure, I impute the mother
with an income of $185,000 a year on a temporary without prejudice basis, to be
adjusted retroactively and prospectively at trial. An income of $185,000 gross
a year would net the mother approximately $120,000 of net disposable income a
year, which more or less meets her budget if the RRSP depletion is removed as
well as the mortgage expenses.
[46]          
Pursuant to the Final Consent Order, the parties
were to share D.’s s.7 expenses equally. The father’s affidavit, filed in
support of the motion lists D.’s s.7 expenses as swimming, math
tutoring/program called Prodigy, summer camps, field trips and meal programs at
school and uninsured medical/dental expenses. He deposes that the mother has
failed to pay her 50% share of D.’s s.7 expenses and is in arrears of $1,873.37.
[47]          
The father is not seeking payment of the s.7
expense arrears right now. He is seeking an order that the mother pay 59% of
D.’s s.7 expenses commencing September 1, 2024, which represents her
proportionate responsibility for D.’s s.7 expenses if her income is imputed at
$300,000 a year.
[48]          
Using this level of income for the mother, and
the father’s T4 income of $239,962, the mother’s proportionate responsibility
toward D.’s s.7 expenses would be 38% and the father’s obligation would be 62%.
[49]          
This court makes the following order:
