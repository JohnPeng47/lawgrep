This costs decision follows a successful motion
by the Defendant, Hantover Canada Inc. (“Hantover”) for a permanent or
temporary stay of proceedings. This court ordered a permanent stay on the basis
that the action is duplicative of an existing action, is an abuse of process,
and raises no reasonable cause of action.
[2]              
Submissions on costs were provided in writing,
as directed by the court. This court further placed a page limit on
submissions, permitting no more than five double-spaced pages, not including a
Bill of Costs. All authorities relied on were to be hyperlinked in the document
or uploaded to Case Center with a hyperlinked index.
[3]              
The Defendant’s submissions complied with this
direction. The Plaintiff’s did not. His submissions were 28 pages long, plus
exhibits, not all of which were case law. In total, the document was 64 pages,
with no hyperlinks. The Plaintiff’s submissions primarily attempted to
relitigate the issues on the motion. The Plaintiff continues to assert
allegations of impropriety against the Defendant and its lawyers. These
submissions, both in length and content, are further evidence that the
Plaintiff believes himself to be unconstrained by orders of the court, the Rules
of Civil Procedure, R.S.O. 1990, Reg. 194, and the law as it applies to the
proceedings that he has initiated.
[4]              
The Defendant seeks its costs on a substantial
indemnity basis on several grounds. Primary of those is the Plaintiff’s
unreasonable conduct in the litigation, which has unnecessarily lengthened the
proceeding and increased its costs. Also of significance is the nature of the
allegations made against the Defendant, which included accusations of fraud,
conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duty.
[5]              
The Defendant seeks its costs of the action on a
substantial indemnity basis in the amount of $86,843.
[6]              
The court has broad discretion in deciding
whether to award costs, to whom, and in what amount: Courts of Justice Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 131. However, that discretion must be exercised in
accordance with the provisions of an Act or the Rules of Civil Procedure:
14657788 Ontario Inc. v. 1122077 Ontario Ltd. (2006), 2006 CanLII 35819 (ON CA), 82 O.R. (3d) 757
(C.A.), at para. 25.
[7]              
Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure
sets out the factors a court may consider when deciding costs. Despite these
factors, the court's authority under Rule 57.01(1) remains discretionary: Ontario
v. Rothmans Inc., 2013 ONCA 353, 115 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 134. Costs
may also be affected by the provisions in Rule 49, which governs cost
consequences when an offer to settle is made and not accepted.
[8]              
Costs rules are designed to foster three
fundamental purposes: (1) to indemnify successful litigants for the cost of
litigation; (2) to encourage settlements; and (3) to discourage and sanction
inappropriate behavior by litigants: Fong v Chan (1999), 1999 CanLII 2052 (ON CA), 46 O.R. (3d)
330 (C.A.), at para. 22; Serra v. Serra, 2009 ONCA 395, 66 R.F.L. (6th)
40, at para. 8.
[9]              
In this era, when judges, lawyers and litigants
are being strongly urged to use court resources more efficiently, courts are
routinely using cost orders to shape how litigants approach their use of the
justice system. The spectre of a cost award against a party taking unnecessary
steps or unreasonable positions is intended to encourage litigants to pursue
only legally sound proceedings, defences and interlocutory steps. The court in 14657788
Ontario Inc., at para. 26, explained that cost awards have shifted
away from the sole or primary purpose of indemnification:
[10]          
The overarching principle when fixing costs is
that the amount of costs awarded be reasonable in the circumstances: Davies
v. Clarington (Municipality), 2009 ONCA 722, 100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 52.
[11]          
The court must also bear in mind the principle
of parity: unsuccessful litigants should expect to pay similar amounts by way
of costs across similar pieces of litigation involving similar conduct: Walker
v. Ritchie, 2006 SCC 45, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 428, at para. 28; 14657788
Ontario Inc., at paras. 39-40.
[12]          
A consideration of experience, rates charged and
hours spent is appropriate, but is subject to the overriding principle of
reasonableness in the context of the particular case.  The quantum awarded should
reflect an amount that the court considers to be fair and reasonable, rather
than any exact measure of the actual costs to the successful party: Anderson
v. St. Jude Medical, Inc. (2006), 2006 CanLII 85158 (ON SCDC), 264 D.L.R. (4th) 557, at
para. 22; Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier
(2002), 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON CA), 21 C.C.E.L. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 4; Boucher v. Public
Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291
(C.A.), at para. 24.
[13]          
The reasonable expectation of the unsuccessful
party is one of the factors to be considered in determining an amount that is
fair and reasonable: St. Jude Medical, at para. 22; Boucher, at
para. 38.
[14]          
The type of considerations that have attracted full indemnity
costs are summarized at para. 124 of Envoy Relocation Services Inc. v. Canada
(Attorney General), 2013 ONSC 2622, as follows:
[15]          
More recently, in Hampton Securities Limited
v. Christina Nicole Dean, 2018 ONSC 1585, at para. 24, aff’d 2018 ONCA 901,
51 C.C.E.L. (4th) 244, the court explained that “[a] legitimate public purpose
of cost orders is to discourage inappropriate conduct. A cost award based on
the principle of full indemnity does that.”
[16]          
In the Reasons for Decision on the motion, at
paragraphs 2 and 6 to 9, I referenced some of the Plaintiff’s conduct that
unnecessarily lengthened the proceeding and complicated the motion.
[17]          
To that I would add: the Plaintiff’s factum was
294 pages in length, his responding motion record 106 pages, and his prohibited
“cross interlocutory motion” record 1,187 pages.
[18]          
It is clear from the evidence on the motion
contained in the affidavit of Kim Poulin that Mr. Graham attempted to explain
to the Plaintiff the numerous problems with his pleading well before this
motion was brought, as early as December 7, 2022. Even in the face of being
advised that he had originally sued the wrong entity, the Plaintiff attempted
to schedule a long motion for an injunction, demanded a statement of defence,
and ultimately noted the incorrectly named defendant in default. With great
clarity (and patience) Mr. Graham’s correspondence repeatedly explained to the Plaintiff
his procedural missteps. The correspondence also shows that the Plaintiff was
obtusely indifferent to those explanations and conducted himself in accordance
with his own interpretation of the Rules and the law.
[19]          
In short, the Plaintiff’s conduct has been
unreasonable throughout this litigation. He has driven up costs unnecessarily.
The pleading itself, being entirely duplicative of another claim in which he
has sued the Defendant, is the ultimate waste of costs, burden on the court
system, and a source of unnecessary harassment for the Defendant. The Defendant
attempted to course-correct the litigation and curtail the costs from the
outset, but these overtures were ignored by the Plaintiff. This is the type of
conduct that should be sanctioned through an elevated cost award. Not only is
this necessary to mark the court’s disapproval of the Plaintiff’s litigation
conduct and to deter others, but to specifically deter the Plaintiff.
[20]          
As noted at paragraphs 22, 25 and 49 of my
Reasons, Mr. Tewari has advanced multiple actions in the Superior Court and has
demonstrated an impulse to appeal decisions of this court whenever possible.
Some of these were referenced in Tewari v. Sekhorn, 2024 ONCA 123. He
also has multiple unpaid cost awards totalling $325,125.56, from this
proceeding and other actions.
[21]          
I note that costs have previously been awarded
on a substantial indemnity basis against the Plaintiff due to his “ongoing
unfounded allegations”: Tewari v. McIntyre, 2023 ONCA 628, at para. 16
(“Tewari (2023)").
[22]          
The claim sought damages of $8.5 million from
the Defendant and accused the Defendant of fraud, conspiracy and breach of
fiduciary duty.
[23]          
In Manning v. Herb Epp, 2006 CanLII 35631
(Ont. S.C.), at para. 8, Lax J. stated that “[w]here serious allegations of
dishonest or illegal acts are made, but are so inadequately pleaded that they
are not permitted to go forward, cost consequences should likewise follow”.
This is sound reasoning, which I adopt.
[24]          
In 1175777 Ontario
Ltd. v. Magna International Inc., 61 R.P.R. (4th) 68 (Ont. S.C.),
the plaintiff failed to prove its conspiracy claim and its entire claim was
dismissed. Costs were awarded to the defendants on a substantial indemnity
basis. Horkins, J. noted that serious allegations were made that attacked the
business ethics of the defendants: at para. 47. At paragraphs 42 and 43, she
determined that substantial indemnity costs were warranted on the basis of the
failed conspiracy allegation against the individual defendant, Frank Stronach.
I see no reasons to distinguish 1175777 Ontario Ltd. from the one before
this court, even though none of the individual officers or directors of the
Defendant were named in the proceeding. The reputation and goodwill of a
corporation deserves consideration of an elevated cost award as much as an
individual in circumstances where no reasonable cause of action can be
established against it, and allegations of fraud and conspiracy have been
levelled against it.
[25]          
I have examined the Bill of Costs of the
Defendant. The Plaintiff made no submissions about the amount of time spent or
the rates charged.
[26]          
Certainly, there are more docketed hours than
what would normally be expected for a motion of this nature. However, I have
considered that this matter has been going on since late 2022 and a significant
amount of resources and time have had to be put to the matter, given its
importance to the Defendant. I have also considered the length of the material
filed by the Plaintiff, and its convoluted nature. There has also been
voluminous correspondence that has arisen from trying to deal efficiently with
the action and the motion. This includes dealing with the Plaintiff’s
resistance to amending his pleading, scheduling a long motion, providing
particulars and his insistence on attempting to proceed with a cross motion
despite clear direction from this court that he was prohibited from doing so
until the Defendant’s motion was determined.
[27]          
In his submissions, the Plaintiff resists any
award of costs, or in the alternative, asked that a cost award be limited to $1,000
with a payment plan, because of impecuniosity.
[28]          
Faced with a similar plea from the unsuccessful
party of inability to pay costs, the Divisional Court in Gravesande v.
Toronto (City) (2006), 2006 CanLII 10749 (ON SCDC), 208 O.A.C. 315 (Div. Ct.) refused to consider
impecuniosity, stating at para. 7 that “[i]t is not part of our mandate, nor
relevant to the issue of costs, to consider the financial circumstances of the
party who is ordered to pay costs”. The court completely changed this position
in Kuffuor v. First Bus Canada, 2014 ONSC 2297 (Div. Ct.), where the
court stated at para. 37 that “the financial circumstances of the losing party
can be a consideration in a decision on costs and is captured by Rule
57.01(1)(i) as ‘any other matter relevant to the question of costs’”. In
reaching that conclusion, the Divisional Court relied on Belvedere v.
Brittain Estate, 2009 ONCA 691, 71 R.F.L. (6th) 1 (Ont.
C.A.). Belvedere is a case in which the Ontario Court of Appeal withheld
costs because of the losing party's financial circumstances, but also because
of what it described as the unfortunate circumstances of the case, being the
express, but legally unenforceable, intention of the testator to benefit the
losing party with a large sum of money through his estate but dying before he
was able to give that intention legal effect. In doing so, the court in Belvedere
noted that this was “one of those rare cases in which the court should exercise
its discretion to make no costs award”: at para. 8.
[29]          
The approach in Kuffuor appears to be the
one now adopted in this court.  In Agius v. Home Depot Holdings
Inc., 2011 ONSC 5272, at para. 17, Justice Ricchetti described the law as
follows:
[30]          
More recently, in Massiah v. Justices of the
Peace Review Council, 2018 ONSC 3097 (Div. Ct.), at para. 14, the court
took into account the applicant’s financial circumstances in determining the
quantum of substantial indemnity costs but noted that “impecuniosity will
not shield litigants from accountability for the costs of
reprehensible, scandalous, and outrageous conduct”.
[31]          
The Plaintiff has not provided evidence of
impecuniosity beyond one screenshot of an account summary, which is not
sufficient to fully gauge his ability to pay a cost award.
[32]          
Further, his unreasonable behavior has resulted
in the Defendant not having to pay its lawyers a modest sum to defend against a
claim that was an abuse of process and disclosed no reasonable cause of action,
but rather a sum that comes close to six figures.
[33]          
An award of costs in the range requested will
not be new to the Plaintiff, and so can be reasonably within his expectation. On
October 31, 2022, Dunphy J. dismissed the Plaintiff’s action and ordered costs
against him in the amount of $172,125.56: Tewari v. McIntyre, 2024 ONSC
6322, at para. 5; Tewari (2023), at para. 4. The Plaintiff appealed
Justice Dunphy’s decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal, where the decision
was upheld and the plaintiff ordered to pay a further $131,000 in costs: Tewari
(2023), at para. 16.
[34]          
The Plaintiff has also been warned throughout
that substantial indemnity costs will be pursued.
[35]          
Having weighed all of the factors in r. 57.01
and stepping back to consider the reasonableness of the costs overall, I award
costs to the Defendant in the amount of $82,000 inclusive. This is slightly
less than the amount requested, in recognition of the likelihood that with four
lawyers and one law clerk working on the file over the last two years, there
will have been some duplication and overlap of work.
