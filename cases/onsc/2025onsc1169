[1]              
This is an uncontested trial. The applicant,
Sophia Hill, seeks a divorce, occupation rent, direction to the solicitor
holding the net proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home to disperse the
proceeds in accordance with her accounting, and costs on a full indemnity basis.
[2]              
I granted a divorce order at the conclusion of
the hearing and reserved on the other relief.
[3]              
The parties began cohabiting in December of
2014. They were married in Jamaica on July 14, 2018 and were separated on
February 13, 2021.
[4]              
The parties have no children together. Ms. Hill
has three children from a previous marriage that resided with the parties
during their relationship.
[5]              
The application was issued on March 5, 2021 and the
respondent, Ian Hill, filed an answer on October 19, 2021.
[6]              
On October 29, 2021, Ms. Hill brought a motion
for the sale of the matrimonial home. Mr. Hill brought a cross-motion for
exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. Ms. Hill’s motion was successful,
and the matrimonial home was listed and sold. The closing date of the sale was April
26, 2022.
[7]              
Ms. Hill served Mr. Hill with a motion to strike
his pleadings for failure to provide disclosure. Justice Parfett adjourned the
motion to allow Mr. Hill to provide the court with the ordered disclosure and
to retain counsel. Justice Parfett also ordered the solicitor holding the net
proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home to pay to Ms. Hill costs from
the previous motion, costs from the
current appearance and a sum of money related to the transfer of title of a 2018
GMC Sierra. $13,000 was released to Mr. Hill to be used to pay a lawyer for the
return of the motion and to assist with compliance with the disclosure orders.
[8]              
Ms. Hill agreed to transfer title to the 2018
GMC Sierra Truck to Mr. Hill and to pay off the existing
loan out of the amount
of money Justice
Parfett awarded her. Mr. Hill thus received a loan-free
vehicle worth about $48,263, which was to come out of his share of the net
proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home.
[9]              
The motion returned before Justice Shelston on
March 21, 2023. Mr. Hill sought a further adjournment. He had not filed any
materials. Nor had he hired a lawyer. Justice Shelston adjourned the motion for
a final time to allow Mr. Hill to file materials.
[10]          
The matter returned before Justice Shelston on
May 9, 2023. Justice Shelston struck Mr. Hill’s claim for an equalization
payment or an unequal division of net family property, and ordered that Ms.
Hill could proceed to an uncontested trial.
[11]          
The uncontested trial materials were submitted
in 2023. On August 30, 2024, the court released an endorsement directing that
the matter was to proceed to a hearing on a regular motions list.
[12]          
Ms. Hill seeks occupation rent from Mr. Hill’s
occupation of the matrimonial home following separation.
[13]          
In considering whether to award occupation rent,
the court must consider the factors set out in Higgins v. Higgins (2001), 2001 CanLII 28223 (ON SC), 19 R.F.L. (5th) 300 (Ont. S.C.).
The principal factors applicable to this case are:
[14]          
The parties jointly owned the home at 1186
William Mooney Road, Carp, Ontario. Ms. Hill purchased the home in 2010. It was
originally listed in her name only when Mr. Hill moved into the home in December
2014.
[15]          
At this time, Ms. Hill was also renting the 4,000
square foot shop space on the property for $1,500 per month to an auto repair
business and towing company.
[16]          
In 2016, Mr. Hill evicted the shop tenants on
the property and took over the shop space for his own roofing business at no
cost. As a result, Ms. Hill no longer benefitted from the rental income from
the shop.
[17]          
Ms. Hill was pressured
by Mr. Hill to transfer ownership
into joint ownership
with him. Ms. Hill did this in March 2018 without consideration from Mr.
Hill.
[18]          
 Ms. Hill paid all the carrying costs of the
matrimonial home from separation, including while Mr. Hill lived there.
[19]          
In addition, Ms. Hill made rental payments on
her own residence following separation in the amount of $2,679 per month.
[20]          
I find that the combined rent and carrying costs
of the matrimonial home totalled $5,279 per month.
[21]          
I am satisfied that Ms. Hill took all
appropriate measures to deal with this matter expeditiously. The parties’ separation
date is February 13, 2021. Ms. Hill had her application issued in March 2021,
and sought the sale of the matrimonial home and occupation rent.
[22]          
By contrast, Mr. Hill delayed the progress of
this matter and flouted court orders. There were several interim orders which
compelled Mr. Hill to pay his 50% share of the carrying costs of the home. He did
not comply with these orders.
[23]          
Mr. Hill also delayed the sale of the
matrimonial home. He only consented to the sale on October 29, 2021, after a motion
seeking that relief was sought by Ms. Hill. He
signed the listing agreement
on January 19, 2022, later than the 30-day timeline ordered by the court, and
the sale didn’t take place until April 2022.
[24]          
In addition, Mr. Hill also refused to pay the
utilities for the matrimonial home after Ms. Hill left. Mr. Hill ordered
propane on Ms. Hill’s account and refused to pay the bill, so she closed the
accounts for heat, hydro and internet in June 2021.
[25]          
The Financial Statement Mr. Hill swore on October
19, 2021 stated that his income was $58,638. This did not take into account any
pre-tax income from his corporation. I am satisfied that Mr. Hill had the ability to pay the carrying
costs of the matrimonial home post-separation.
[26]          
By way of motion, Ms. Hill was only able to
recoup some of the share of the carrying costs of the home from the proceeds of the home.
[27]          
Although Ms. Hill alleges that Mr. Hill made a malicious
complaint to the police—which led to charges for which she was ultimately
acquitted—I need not make any findings in this regard.
[28]          
Rather, in the circumstances, I am satisfied
that Mr. Hill should pay occupation rent based on the above factors.
[29]          
Based on the appraisals filed, I am satisfied
that one half of the rental value of the home is $2,250 per month.
[30]          
Mr. Hill shall pay occupation rent from the date
of separation to the date of the sale of the matrimonial home, which totals
$31,500.
[31]          
The net proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial
home were $361,908.20. At that time, Mr. Hill’s half of the proceeds were $180,954.10.
[32]          
From Mr. Hill’s share, I deduct the following
amounts:
[33]          
As a result, I direct the solicitor holding the
net proceeds of sale pay to Mr. Hill $40,220.60.  From this, $5,000 shall be held
back pending Mr. Hill’s compliance with Justice Shelston’s order dated May 9,
2023 to return Ms. Hill’s contents from the matrimonial home. If he fails to do
so within 30 days of this endorsement, I order that Ms. Hill be paid the $5,000.
[34]          
I further direct that that the solicitor holding
the net proceeds of sale pay to Ms. Hill the balance of the funds held in
trust.
[35]          
Ms. Hill withdraws her claims for equalization
of net family property and unequal division of net family property because she does
not have enough disclosure required to calculate what either party would owe as
a payment. The withdrawals of these claims are without prejudice to Ms. Hill
pursuing these claims in future proceedings raising the equalization claim.
[36]          
Under the Family Law Rules, O. Reg.
439/07, s. 1, “proportionality and reasonableness are the touchstone
considerations to be applied in fixing the amount of costs”: Beaver v. Hill, 2018 ONCA 840, 143 O.R.
(3d) 519, para. 12. Rule 24(14) sets
out the appropriate considerations in fixing the quantum of costs.
[37]          
Ms. Hill seeks full indemnity costs in the
amount of $29,606, all inclusive. I am not persuaded that this is an
appropriate case to award Ms. Hill full indemnity costs. That said, Mr. Hill’s
conduct and flouting of court orders is deserving of sanction. His conduct caused
hardship to Ms. Hill.
[38]          
Accordingly, I find that this is an appropriate
case to award costs at a rate of 70% of the costs incurred by Ms. Hill.
[39]          
The untimely passing of Ms. Hill’s previous
counsel inevitably caused some duplication in work despite the efforts of her successor
counsel to minimize this. Mr. Hill should not have to bear the burden of this.
[40]          
I also make a reduction for overall
reasonableness.
[41]          
Therefore, I award Ms. Hill $19,000 in costs.
[42]          
The application is granted in accordance with
these reasons. Ms. Hill shall send my judicial assistant a draft judgment for
my review.
