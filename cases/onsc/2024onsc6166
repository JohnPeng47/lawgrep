In submissions made on October 31, 2024, counsel to JTI-Macdonald Corp.
(“JTI”) stated that JTI was supportive of the Claims Procedure Order and
requested comment in the endorsement in respect of the adequacy of notice
“because this is an important element in terms of the effectiveness of the
release contemplated by the plan”.

Through oversight, this did not happen and is now being addressed.

I am satisfied that the notice elements in the Claims Procedure Orders
are reasonable in the circumstances.
