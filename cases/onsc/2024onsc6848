[1]              
These reasons are supplementary to my Reasons
for Decision dated December 5, 2024 (2024 ONSC 6810).
[2]              
After the release of my reasons, I became aware
of a decision called Mazur v. Elias et al. 2005 CanLII 11390 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No 1407 (C.A.).
which was not provided to me by either counsel.
[3]              
In Mazur the Court of Appeal decided [at para.
12] that it is unnecessary for the purpose of s. 192 of the Highway Traffic
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 for one owner to have the consent of the co-owner
before liability will attach to both.
[4]              
I therefore wish to correct paragraph 29 of my
Reasons for Decision to delete the last sentence which reads, “As a result,
pursuant to s. 192(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, Ms. Malcolm’s consent flowed
through Mr. Le Brun to Ms. Campbell”. Pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s
decision in Mazur, Ms. Malcolm’s consent was unnecessary since Mr. Le
Brun was a co-owner of the vehicle.  Liability will therefore attach to both.
[5]              
My determination in paragraph 30 remains the same.
