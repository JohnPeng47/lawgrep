[1]              
The Applicants seek an order to enforce Letters
Rogatory dated October 26, 2022, issued by the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, authorized by the Honourable
Sheila M. Finnegan, United States Magistrate Judge.
[2]              
In the Illinois action, the Applicants are plaintiffs
and representatives of a class certified against Amazon.com Inc. and Amazon.com
Services LLC (collectively “Amazon”).
[3]              
In support of its defences, Amazon seeks
production and discovery from the Respondent, ModiFace Inc. (“ModiFace”) which is
a Canadian corporation located in Toronto, Ontario.  ModiFace is not a party to
the action and has no ties to Illinois or to the United States.
[4]              
ModiFace resists the Illinois order because its
scope is too broad, requiring it to provide its “source code” which would have potentially
devastating consequences to its business.  It is prepared to provide the source
code in “compiled” and “obfuscated” form and submit to the deposition process provided
there are procedural protections in place as per Rule 34.12 of the
Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure[1].
[5]              
To their credit, the parties have conducted extensive
discussions and have resolved most of the items in the Letters Rogatory, except
for the following:
[6]              
For reasons that follow, I determine that the
Applicants have not met their evidentiary burden to show that production of the
source code is relevant or necessary in accordance with Ontario law.  I also
find that the request for the source code is against public policy and shall
not be produced.
[7]              
Although I am therefore not prepared to grant
the Applicants’ request, I order ModiFace to provide their compiled and obfuscated
code to the Applicants and to submit to a deposition as per the order attached
at Schedule “A” to these reasons.
[8]              
Because my order limits the scope of production,
I am not prepared to order costs of compliance and the costs of responding to
this application without further submissions from both parties (see below).
[9]              
ModiFace is a software company which specializes
in augmented reality (“AR”) technology which it licences to various beauty
brands and other companies, including Amazon.  The AR technology is a
proprietary, specialized form of computer software created in Canada by employees
of ModiFace.
[10]          
There is no corporate connection between
ModiFace and Amazon, other than the licencing arrangement; Amazon is both a
client of ModiFace and a competitor with respect to its AR technology.
[11]          
ModiFace does not interact directly with
Amazon’s users, receives no user-specific data from Amazon’s capture of the data,
and does not store such data.
[12]          
In the Illinois class action, the Applicants
allege that Amazon violated Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act [2] (“BIPA”) by capturing
and storing biometric data through virtual-try-on (“VTO”) programs which allow
consumers to virtually try on cosmetics or other products using a photograph or
live video of the consumer’s face to simulate how these products would look on
the consumer in person.
[13]          
Through the deposition process in Illinois, the
Applicants learned that the two VTO programs integrated by Amazon into its
website and mobile application were developed by ModiFace and licenced to
Amazon.
[14]          
In response to an interrogatory about how the
VTO programs work, Amazon refused to provide and answer with respect to the
ModiFace VTO program because such an inquiry is “properly directed at ModiFace
and seeks information outside Amazon’s possession, custody or control”.
[15]          
In response to a request to produce the source
code for each VTO feature used by Amazon, Amazon responded that it “does not
have possession, custody, or control of the source code”.
[16]          
Two motions were brought for production of
information and documents related to the ModiFace VTO program, which were
denied on the basis that the information sought was not within Amazon’s
possession, custody, or control.
[17]          
On October 26, 2022, the Illinois Court issued
Letters Rogatory requesting judicial assistance from this court to compel
ModiFace to provide deposition testimony, and to produce certain information
and documents which they had concluded are “directly relevant and material to”,
“necessary to”, and “not otherwise obtainable”. The Illinois Court concluded
that compelling ModiFace to produce this scope of “source code” material is
“fair, appropriate, and necessary under the circumstances”.
[18]          
On April 20, 2023, the Applicants filed this
application to enforce the Letters Rogatory.
[19]          
The Applicants take the position that ModiFace’s
source code is crucial to their action against Amazon and should be produced in
un-obfuscated form. ModiFace takes the position that its source code is
proprietary and highly confidential and should not be produced other than in
obfuscated form and with appropriate confidentiality safeguards in place.
[20]          
“Source code” is the foundational code written
by programmers which is structured to be human-readable and understandable.  Once
completed, it is converted into “compiled code” which is used to run the
program. Compiled code may be “obfuscated” to make replication more difficult.
[21]          
In the normal course, ModiFace provides its AR
technology to Amazon as a package of compiled and obfuscated code which allows Amazon
to deploy the technology.  ModiFace submits that providing the code in this
form still allows the input and output to be visible and allows insight into
the code’s behaviour allowing the Applicants and their experts to understand
the AR technology’s functionality.
[22]          
ModiFace also submits that production of
un-obfuscated source code, even under strict confidentiality, risks exposing its
core proprietary technology to competitors (of which Amazon is one) and to the
public, risking irreparable harm to ModiFace.
[23]          
Segregating the source code specific to the
Amazon version of the code would require hundreds of hours at significant cost
to ModiFace.  Without this work, producing the source code from its
repositories would expose all versions of its AR technology, not just the one
used by Amazon.
[24]          
Paragraph 14 of Schedule A of the Letters
Rogatory requests that ModiFace produce:
[25]          
The Letters Rogatory provide as follows:
[26]          
The Applicants retained Mr. Isaac Pflaum, a
software expert, to provide an affidavit explaining why the source code for the
ModiFace VTO program is required in the Illinois action.   In his opinion, the
source code “provides the greatest transparency for analyzing how software
performs its functions” at issue, and “reading the source code is necessary to
gain a complete understanding of …how and why [the ModiFace VTO program] works”
and “to comprehensively opine on all of the issues presented” in the Illinois action.
[27]          
Mr. Pflaum explained that in his experience,
source code is “typically” produced in U.S. litigation in which the program’s
capabilities and/or what steps it takes to perform those functions are relevant
because the source code is what establishes those steps and capabilities.  In his
view, receiving source code in “un-obfuscated”, “un-minificated” [3], and “un-compiled” form
is necessary to understand what the ModiFace VTO program does because those
processes make it extremely difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, “if not
impossible”, to review and understand the source code.
[28]          
ModiFace’s Chief Executive Officer and head
developer, Mr. Jeff Houghton, a provided a responding affidavit in which he
explained that providing the source code in obfuscated form permits the
Applicants to confirm how the ModiFace AR technology works locally on a user’s
device and to confirm that it does not involve the collection, storage, capture
or transfer of biometric information or identifiers.
[29]          
There is no dispute that the source code is confidential;
the Applicants do not propose releasing the source code to Amazon and are willing
to sign a confidentiality agreement.
[30]          
The Respondents submit that “once the bell has
been rung, it cannot be un-rung” and oppose production of the source code even with
strict confidentiality safeguards.
[31]          
Section 60 of the Ontario Evidence Act[4] and
ss. 46 and 47 of the Canada Evidence Act[5]
authorize this court to order the production of documents and the examination
under oath of Ontario residents at the request of a foreign country.
[32]          
There are four statutory preconditions for
enforcing letters rogatory:
[33]          
The parties agree that the statutory
preconditions for enforcing the Applicants’ request have been satisfied.
[34]          
The parties also agree on the general principles
surrounding the granting of requests from foreign courts which are enforced by
Ontario courts pursuant to the principles of international comity, mutual deference,
and respect.[7] 
They also agree that Ontario courts will enforce letters rogatory that are not
contrary to the public policy of Canada and Ontario, and if there is no
prejudice to the sovereignty or the citizens of Canada[8].
[35]          
In each case, the court must “step back and
balance” Canadian sovereignty considerations.[9] 
Ontario courts are not bound to accept the conclusions of the foreign court on
relevance or necessity as final[10]
and will not permit a “fishing expedition”.[11]
[36]          
The parties also agree that the following
non-exclusive “guideposts” or “factors”, set out in Friction Division[12], should
be considered by this court in exercising discretion to enforce letters
rogatory:
[37]          
Because satisfaction of the statutory
preconditions is not disputed, the analysis of whether to grant the request of
the Illinois court and enforce the Letters Rogatory as against ModiFace is
focused on the six Friction Division[14]
factors.
[38]          
The Applicants have not suggested that the
conclusions of the Illinois court, stated in the Letters Rogatory when deciding
to make this request, are determinative of this application.
[39]          
It is open to me to narrow a request for international
judicial assistance if the supporting material sustains a more circumscribed
request.[15]
[40]          
While a systematic examination of each is not
required, and the Friction Division factors need not be rigidly applied
in each case, this court must itself be satisfied, on the record presented on
this application, of the recognized factors and the “overarching principles of
comity, public policy, and the absence of prejudice to the sovereignty of the
citizens of Canada.”[16]
[41]          
The Applicants have the onus of establishing the
Friction Division factors[17].
[42]          
ModiFace maintains that the Applicants have
failed to establish these factors. Aside from the disagreement about the cost
burden in complying with the requests, ModiFace’s opposition to this
application can be generally broken down into concerns about relevance
and necessity because the proposed production of obfuscated source code will
satisfy the Applicants’ inquiries regarding how the code functions and how it
stores any data.  Additionally, Modiface takes the position that production of
their source code is against public policy because of the potential
detrimental effect on its business.  I will address these issues in turn.
[43]          
Relevance is case and fact specific.  Although there
is an attraction to affording some deference to the foreign court on the
question of relevance of the evidence sought since that is a matter that is
ultimately withing its domain,[18]
the Ontario court is not bound to accept the language or conclusions of the
letters rogatory as the “final say”. Instead, it must independently assess the
evidence to reach its own conclusions.[19]
[44]          
The Applicants rely on several American cases
which were decided under different legislation, discovery rules and case law
and are not binding upon this court.  I will therefore not refer to them.
[45]          
Aker Biomarine AS
et al. v. KGK Synergize Inc.[20]
summarizes the important principles to be considered by this court when
deciding whether to grant requests from foreign courts pursuant to letters rogatory
and the reasons why caution should be exercised.  Leach J. stated:
[46]          
The Court of Appeal in Actava TV, Inc. v.
Matvil Corp.[23]
distinguished between “want” and “need” when determining relevancy.  Although
the opposing expert may “want” the information, this does not make it
“relevant” for the purposes of obtaining it from a disinterested non-party.
[47]          
In Cisco Systems v. N. Harris Computer Corporation[24] MacLeod, R.S.J. dealt
with the issue of producibility of source code in a Texas patent dispute. He
noted that there is an important distinction between cases in which source code
is relevant (such as in a computer program copyright or intellectual property case)
and cases where it is not. Under Ontario production rules, before the court would
make an order requiring a non-party to submit to expert analysis the court
would require specific evidence from an expert as to why the information is
“essential”.[25]
[48]          
Here, as in Cisco, the underlying U.S. action is
not a copyright nor an intellectual property dispute involving the computer
code, but rather a dispute regarding the functionality of the program and the
uses (or misuses) to which it is put.
[49]          
The expert retained by the Applicants, Mr.
Pflaum, indicates the source code provides the “greatest transparency for
analyzing how software performs its functions” and that obfuscation makes it
“extremely difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, if not impossible, to
review and understand the source code”.
[50]          
In response, Mr. Houghton, ModiFace’s CEO and
lead developer deposed that even in obfuscated form, the format still permits
the Applicants to confirm how the ModiFace AR technology works locally on a
user’s device and to confirm that it does not involve the collection, storage,
capture or transfer of biometric information or identifiers.
[51]          
Nowhere in Mr. Pflaum’s affidavit does he
indicate that obtaining the source code in its original form is “essential”; simply
that it offers the best transparency. While it may be difficult and
time-consuming to use obfuscated code, he offers no proof that it, in fact, is impossible.
 While Mr. Pflaum may “want” the source code, he offers no proof of “need” as per
the Court of Appeal’s decision in Actava TV.  Therefore, in my view,
the Applicants have not discharged their burden of proof with respect to
relevance.
[52]          
The need to establish “necessity” acts as a
safeguard to ensure that the Ontario court is not requiring one of its citizens
to participate in a process that may be of no assistance to the foreign
litigation.[26]
[53]          
Mr. Pflaum explained in his affidavit that source
code is “typically” produced in U.S. litigation in which the program’s
capabilities and/or the steps it takes to perform those functions are relevant
because the source code is what establishes those steps and capabilities.  In
his view, receiving the source code is “necessary” to understand what the
ModiFace VTO program does.
[54]          
Although he asserts necessity, Mr. Pflaum does not
offer evidence that in this particular case it would be unfair to
require the Applicants to proceed to trial without discovery of the source code
as per Rule 30.10(1)(b).[27] 
Mr. Houghton attested that the code remains executable, functional, and will
allow the Applicants’ experts to gain insight into its behaviour for trial
purposes.  The Applicants have offered no evidence to show that the required
analysis cannot be accomplished using obfuscated code; it is simply
expensive and time-consuming.  Mr. Pflaum acknowledges in his affidavit that
the obfuscated code “would behave exactly the same” as un-obfuscated code. I
therefore find that the Applicants have not discharged their burden of proof
with respect to necessity.
[55]          
Again, the Illinois action is not an
intellectual property or copyright case.  No reason has been given by Mr.
Pflaum as to why he cannot render an expert opinion to the Applicants based
upon obfuscated code in which the functionality of the VTO program is at issue;
in my view there is insufficient evidence that the obfuscated code is inadequate
for the purposes of the underlying litigation. I therefore find that the
Applicants have not discharged their burden to prove the evidence is not
otherwise obtainable.
[56]          
Our Court of Appeal in Actava TV made it
clear that the court would decline to enforce letters rogatory if enforcement
is contrary to public policy.[28]
[57]          
There is no defined list of the various public
policy considerations that may lead a court to refuse to enforce.  The focus is
on whether granting the request, not the underlying foreign proceeding,
contravenes Canadian public policy.[29]
[58]          
Confidentiality concerns may be considered as
part of the public policy analysis,[30] 
specifically, business confidentiality concerns[31] and trade secrets[32]. Requiring a non-party
to disclose sensitive, confidential information can run contrary to public
policy, especially when the confidential information “strikes at the heart” of
the non-party’s business information.[33]
[59]          
The information sought from ModiFace is a trade
secret which strikes at its very existence.  Like the financial information
sought in Actava TV, nothing could be more confidential and open to
abusive use.[34]
Even if there were sufficient evidence of relevance and necessity, in my view, it
is contrary to public policy to require ModiFace to disclose its source code. The
potential consequences of disclosure to a competitor (Amazon) and to the
public, even with a protective order in place, are potentially ruinous to
ModiFace, a non-party.  This court is therefore not prepared to force ModiFace,
a Canadian company, to face such consequences even with safeguards in place,
especially since a viable option exists to provide the information consistent
with comity.
[60]          
The request from the Illinois court is for “all
computer code (including but not limited to the source code) for each version
of each ModiFace VTO program used between September 7, 2016 and the present”.
[61]          
Counsel for the Applicants submits that all
iterations of the source code within this timeframe are required to determine
whether there has been a breach of BIPA[35].
  Counsel for ModiFace submits that only the latest iteration of the obfuscated
source code should be produced because it subsumes all the previous iterations.
To force production of the previous versions would, again, reveal their
proprietary source code and would be extremely onerous.
[62]          
Since I have ordered that only the obfuscated
source code is to be produced, which incorporates all of the earlier iterations,
I decline to order production of previous versions.
[63]          
Since less intrusive methods of obtaining the necessary
information are available, in my view it is unlikely that an Ontario court
would order ModiFace, a non-party, to produce the source code if the underlying
action were in Ontario.
[64]          
Moreover, the Applicants have failed to explain
why the burden of “painstaking work” should be placed on ModiFace, rather than
on themselves, particularly where ModiFace is not a party to the Illinois
action.
[65]          
For these reasons, I conclude that the order
sought against ModiFace is unduly burdensome.
[66]          
Although U.S. and Canada have somewhat
comparable justice systems, the rules relating to discovery are significantly
dissimilar[36]
and significantly broader in the United States.[37]
[67]          
Rule 31.07 contemplates that a witness on
discovery may refuse to answer a question and Rule 34.12 deals with the
procedure applicable to objections.  Other jurisdictions, even within Canada, force
deponents to answer questions despite objections. [38]
[68]          
ModiFace is concerned that during the
deposition, it may be forced to answer questions over its objections, which
could have the effect of exposing the source code. They propose safeguards in
their draft order such that this court will decide any disputes regarding
refusals under Ontario law and will maintain control over the process.
[69]          
I have reviewed ModiFace’s draft order and agree
that such concerns are well-founded.  I have therefore incorporated the terms
they propose into the order attached at Schedule “A” to these reasons.
[70]          
Given that my decision limits the scope of
production of the source code, counsel may wish to have further discussions.
[71]          
If counsel cannot agree on the costs of
compliance with my order, and the costs of the application, they may make
additional submissions as follows:
[72]          
If no written cost submissions are received within
two weeks of the release of this decision, there shall be no costs awarded.
