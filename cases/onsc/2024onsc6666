     Francois
Tonge, Scott Macpherson, Greg Stevenson, Paul Owen, 1073639 Ontario Inc., and
Kingston Hub Group Inc. (collectively, the “moving parties”) bring this motion
for partial summary judgment to strike the plaintiffs’ derivative claim, to
appoint independent counsel for Kingston Hub Group Realty Inc. (“Realty Inc.”),
and for leave to amend their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.
[2]    
     The
essential facts are as follows: In 2007, a group of businessmen incorporated
two entities—Kingston Hub Group Inc. (“Hub Group”),
which operates three successful bars and restaurants in Kingston, Ontario, and
Realty Inc., which owns the real estate from which these businesses operate.
Brian George was a principal investor in both corporations. The plaintiff,
Nammarra Dokken-George, is Brian George’s widow.  Mr. George passed away in
2012.
[3]    
     Prior
to his passing, Brian George held 70% of the shares of Realty Inc. and 45% of
the shares in Hub Group through his holding company, 1178448 Ontario Inc. The
remaining shares were held by the moving parties.
[4]    
     Ms.
Dokken-George inherited Mr. George’s shares in both corporations. The moving
parties sought to acquire Mr. George’s shares pursuant to the terms of a
Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, which stipulated buyout rights for
shareholders in the event of death. The moving parties commenced an application
in this Court, however, the parties subsequently reached a settlement in 2013.
Under the terms of the settlement, Ms. Dokken-George sold all of Mr. George’s
interest in Hub Group to the moving parties and 20% of his shares in Realty
Inc.
[5]    
     As a
result, Ms. Dokken-George owns 50% of Realty Inc., while the moving parties
hold the remaining 50%, and they own 100% of Hub Group.
[6]    
     The
primary dispute between Ms. Dokken-George and the moving parties concerns the
rental payments that Hub Group is obligated to make to Realty Inc. According to
the moving parties, it was always understood that Hub Group would pay Realty
Inc. rent sufficient to cover its mortgage servicing costs only, thereby
operating on a profit-neutral basis. They contend that only upon the discharge
of Realty Inc.’s mortgages, Hub Group would commence payment of market rent to
Realty Inc.
[7]    
     This
arrangement, however, has proven unsatisfactory to Ms. Dokken-George. Following
the settlement reached in 2013, she owns 50% of Realty Inc., a corporation that
holds real estate valued at several million dollars. Despite this ownership,
she receives no dividends from Realty Inc. and she is required to pay half of
Realty Inc.’s property taxes from her personal funds.
[8]    
     In
2018, Ms. Dokken-George demanded that Hub Group pay Realty Inc. market rent.
She contends that any previous agreement to pay rent limited to covering
mortgage costs may have been reasonable while Mr. George was a shareholder in
Hub Group, as any reduction in rent payable to Realty Inc. would have provided
a corresponding benefit to Hub Group. However, she asserts that she no longer
has any stake in Hub Group.
[9]    
     Realty
Inc.'s mortgages were satisfied in 2022, and the moving parties acknowledge
that Hub Group is now obligated to pay Realty Inc. the market rent. However,
the parties remain in disagreement regarding the amount of market rent, having
obtained competing appraisals that reflect a significant disparity.
[10]    
 Ms. Dokken-George commenced
this action on December 15, 2020, in her name, on behalf of her holding
company, and on behalf of Realty Inc. The action asserts an oppression remedy
and a derivative claim in favor of Realty Inc. Additionally, she has advanced
claims against Realty Inc.’s accountants, but these claims are not pertinent to
the motion currently before the Court.
[11]    
 Ms. Dokken-George alleges
that the moving parties failed to remit proper rental payments to Realty Inc.
since December 1, 2011. She contends that the defendants, as tenants and 50%
shareholders of Realty Inc., engaged in self-dealing that prioritized their
interests and those of Hub Group over her interests and those of Realty Inc.
Specifically, she alleges that the defendants:
[12]    
 Ms. Dokken-George sought
leave of the court to bring this action in the name of Realty Inc. for the
purpose of prosecuting this action at paragraph 1f) of her claim.  She brought
a motion to that effect and on June 9, 2021, Justice Mew granted the Order on consent.
[13]      This motion raises three issues:
[14]    
 The moving parties’ motion
for leave to amend their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim was not opposed,
and an order shall issue granting them leave to amend.
[15]    
 The defendants seek the
dismissal of Ms. Dokken-George’s action pursuant to Rule 20.01(3)[1],
arguing that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. They present two
primary arguments: First, they contend that her derivative action is a nullity
because Justice Mew’s June 9, 2021 Order did not grant leave to bring the
derivative action nunc pro tunc. Second, they argue that the action does
not serve the interests of Realty Inc. and, consequently, cannot be sustained.
[16]    
 Section 246 of the Business
Corporations Act (the “OBCA”) permits a complainant to apply to the court for
leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of a corporation. Justice
Mew granted that Order. Paragraph 1 of the Order reads:
[17]    
 The Order also allowed the moving
parties to plead and assert any claims or defences available to them.
[18]    
 The moving parties argue
that Ms. Dokken-George’s derivative action is a nullity because a complainant
must obtain leave before instituting a derivative action. They assert that, in
circumstances where the action is commenced prior to obtaining the necessary
leave under section 246 of the OBCA, a nunc pro tunc order can be sought. 
The defendants further contend that since Justice Mew did not grant leave nunc
pro tunc, the action is therefore a nullity.
[19]    
 I would not give effect to
this submission.  The defendants consented to Ms. Dokken-George’s motion for
leave to initiate and maintain the derivative action. Their argument
effectively claims that they consented to an order that is without any legal effect.
It is evident to the Court that, by consenting to the order granting the
plaintiff leave to maintain this action, the parties intended for the order to
have the requisite retroactive effect.
[20]    
 A complainant bringing a
derivative action must satisfy the court that:
[21]    
 On November 15, 2023, the
plaintiffs brought a motion to wind up Realty Inc. by listing its properties
for sale and requiring Hub Group to vacate those properties. That motion was
stayed pending the outcome of this motion.  The defendants contend that the
plaintiffs’ motion for a wind up has fundamentally altered the landscape, and
that it is now clear that that the plaintiff is not pursuing the derivative
action in Realty Inc.’s interest.
[22]    
 The Court notes that an
order for the winding up of Realty Inc. was specifically pleaded in paragraph
1(j)(viii) of the Statement of Claim. Despite the plaintiffs’ request for this
relief, the defendants consented to the order granting the plaintiffs leave to
pursue the derivative action. However, it does not appear that this relief was
brought to Justice Mew’s attention. The Court also observes that the moving
parties’ themselves seek an order to wind up Realty Inc., if necessary, in
their Counterclaim.
[23]    
 The moving parties argue
that, notwithstanding Justice Mew’s Order, this Court retains jurisdiction to
oversee the propriety of derivative action after a complainant has been granted
leave, especially when the complainant acts contrary to the interests of the
corporation on behalf of which the claim is brought.  In D’Amore v. Russ,
it was held that such power is implicitly recognized under section 245 of the
OBCA:
[24]    
 The defendants assert that
Ms. Dokken-George’s motion to wind up Realty Inc. serves her personal interests
and is contrary to the corporation’s interests. They argue that her motion does
not seek to advance the interests of the corporation but its demise.
[25]    
 A complainant need only meet
a relatively low threshold to satisfy the Court that the proposed derivative
action “appears to be” in the interests of the corporation. Some courts have
determined that this test is satisfied when the intended action “does not
appear frivolous or vexatious and could reasonably succeed” or presents an
"arguable case."[4]
[26]      While
a corporation’s interests may encompass a variety of factors,[5]
I agree with the moving parties that seeking the winding up of a commercially
viable corporation is not in its interests. A derivative action is pursued for
corporate relief, aimed at recovering for wrongs committed against the
corporation itself. An order for winding up does not achieve that aim.
[27]    
 Nevertheless, with the
exception of the winding-up order, Ms. Dokken-George’s interests align with
those of Realty Inc. She alleges that the defendants engaged in non-arms’
length dealings that were detrimental to Realty Inc. She contends that the
defendants failed to pay Realty Inc. market rent, which benefited Hub Group
while disadvantaging Realty Inc. and herself as a shareholder. The moving
parties forcefully dispute these allegations, and it is not the Court's role to
assess their validity within the context of this motion. To the extent that her
claims hold any merit, the relief sought in this action appears to benefit both
herself as a shareholder and Realty Inc. as a corporation.
[28]    
 The Court therefore
concludes that the proposed derivative action appears to be in Realty Inc.’s
interest, apart from the request for an order to wind up the corporation.
[29]    
 I concur with the moving parties
that the same counsel cannot represent Ms. Dokken-George and Realty Inc. due to
a conflict of interest. An order for the winding up of Realty Inc. would
benefit Ms. Dokken-George but would be contrary to the interests of Realty Inc.
However, I decline to issue an order appointing independent counsel to
represent Realty Inc.'s interests.
[30]    
 Pursuant to section 247 of
the OBCA, the Court may make any order it deems appropriate, including
directives regarding the conduct of the action.
[31]    
 In accordance with this
section, the Court orders that the derivative action be stayed until the
determination of Ms. Dokken-George’s oppression action and her action against
Realty Inc.’s accountants. This order will not prejudice Ms. Dokken-George’s
rights, allows her counsel to represent her in the oppression claim without
conflict, and promotes the most expeditious and cost-effective resolution of
this action on its merits.
[32]    
 Both parties agree that
Realty Inc. must be included as a party to this action. The parties are
directed to request a case conference before me to discuss whether any
modifications should be made to the style of cause as a result of this Court’s
order.  They may file a case conference brief, not exceeding three pages, at
least three days before the case conference.
[33]    
 The moving parties are
granted leave to amend their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim in the
manner set forth in Schedule “A” to their notice of motion.
[34]    
 In light of the mixed
results obtained in this motion, and considering that the moving parties should
have opposed the plaintiff’s motion for leave to initiate a derivative action
given that the plaintiff had sought an order for the winding up of Realty Inc.
in her Statement of Claim, the Court makes no order as to costs.
