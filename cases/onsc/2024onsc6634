In the main action, the plaintiff homebuilder,
Leanne Homes Limited (“LHL”), seeks recovery of damages, including loss of
market value, reduction in resale value, expenses, fees, and carrying costs
from the defendants for breach of an agreement of purchase and sale, more
particularized below.
[2]              
On this motion, LHL seeks an interim,
interlocutory injunction against the defendant, Avtansh Singh (“Avtansh”),
prohibiting him from selling the property located at 6491 Edenwood Drive,
Mississauga (the “Mississauga Property”).  Avtansh owns the Mississauga Property
with Simranjeet Chabra Singh as tenants-in-common.
[3]              
In the alternative, should the Mississauga Property
be sold, LHL seeks an order that the proceeds of sale be held in trust, or paid
into Court, pending the conclusion of this action.
[4]              
LHL submits that if the injunction is not
granted, it will have no means to recover any judgment it may obtain in the main
action.
[5]              
On May 23, 2021, the three defendants executed
an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (“APS”) with LHL for the purchase of a new home
in Shelburne, Ontario (the “Shelburne Property”).  The sale price was
$1,182,990, for which the defendants paid a $170,000 deposit.
[6]              
LHL delivered to the defendants two Notices of
Unavoidable Delay in 2022.
[7]              
On June 6, 2023, LHL set a firm closing date of
January 18, 2024.
[8]              
Over this period of time, the defendants
requested extensions, which LHL granted.
[9]              
The defendants did not close on the scheduled
closing date of January 18, 2024, and the APS was terminated on January 22,
2024.
[10]          
LHL has not returned the $170,000 deposit.
[11]          
LHL issued its statement of claim on January 29,
2024.
[12]          
Gurmeet Singh and Parneet Kaur Dhunna, who are
spouses, were initially represented by Mr. Reddington.  They have since
absconded (the “Absconding Defendants”).  LHL was successful in obtaining a Mareva
injunction against the Absconding Defendants under a separate court action
(CV-24-00000417).
[13]          
It is LHL’s evidence that the Absconding
Defendants have been depleting the equity in their properties with a view to
defeating LHL’s ability to recover damages.  LHL seeks to paint Avtansh with
the same brush.
[14]          
LHL submits that Avtansh is attempting to
liquidate his assets in his efforts to sell the Mississauga Property through the
Multiple Listing Service (“MLS”) and private sale.
[15]          
It is LHL’s position that it will suffer
irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted.  Moreover, the balance of
convenience, and the interests of justice, favour the granting of the
injunctive relief.
[16]          
Avtansh submits that LHL has failed to mitigate
its losses, as the Shelburne Property is not yet listed for sale.  Further, LHL
has failed to provide particulars of any damages it has suffered.
[17]          
Avtansh bought the Mississauga Property in order
to provide a home for himself and his new wife while awaiting completion of the
Shelburne Property.  He and his wife continue to reside there.
[18]          
In his affidavit sworn in response to LHL’s
motion, Avtansh said he has no intention of selling the Mississauga Property.
[19]          
During cross-examination on his affidavit,
Avtansh advised that he tried to sell the Mississauga Property on the MLS in
anticipation of the January 18, 2024 closing date but did not get any showings
or offers.  He has not listed it since.
[20]          
The only evidence in support of LHL’s contention
that Avtansh is trying to sell the Mississauga Property is an undated MLS
listing.  In any event, Avtansh did not deny he tried to sell the Mississauga
Property.
[21]          
The only issue to be determined by this court is
whether LHL has satisfied the test for an interim injunction.  The leading
authority in respect of injunctions remains RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada
(Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, which provides the following
three-part test that a moving party must meet at pp. 348-349:
[22]          
In RJR-MacDonald, the Supreme Court held
that a “serious issue to be tried” is a low threshold, and this aspect of the
test is satisfied as long as the action is neither frivolous nor vexatious.
[23]          
This test is met here.  The plaintiff has a
strong prima facie case for breach of contract.
[24]          
What is the nature of the harm LHL will suffer
if the injunction is not granted?  LHL suggests that any judgment obtained will
be hollow if Avtansh and the Absconding Defendants dissipate all of their
assets.
[25]          
It is on this branch of the test that LHL’s
motion fails.  In the absence of any quantification of damages, what
irreparable harm will LHL suffer?  The record is silent in this regard.  In
other words, there is no evidence to suggest what LHL’s damages might be, or
whether they will even exceed the $170,000 deposit.
[26]          
When asked what steps LHL has taken to sell the
Shelburne Property in order to crystalize its loss, counsel advised that
efforts to sell on both the MLS, and privately, have been unsuccessful.  I
reminded counsel that this evidence was not properly before the court.  Counsel
asked for an opportunity to submit a further affidavit outlining LHL’s efforts
to mitigate its damages.  That request was denied.
[27]          
While this is not a summary judgment motion, on
any motion, the moving party has an obligation to put their best foot forward. 
This is particularly so when the moving party seeks to prohibit the responding
party from performing a particular act.
[28]          
I did permit counsel to submit, after the motion
was concluded, any cases he could find in which a court had granted an
injunction in the absence of quantifiable damages.  These cases, which I have
reviewed, are distinguishable.
[29]          
For example, in Christian-Philip v.
Rajalingam, 2020 ONSC 1925, 58 C.P.C. (8th) 146, there was no evidence that
the defendants had the means to satisfy any judgment obtained by the
plaintiff.  In this case, LHL has the $170,000 deposit from which it can recoup
its losses.
[30]          
Which of the parties before the court will
suffer the greater harm if the interlocutory injunction is granted or refused?
[31]          
I find that Avtansh would suffer the greater
harm.  LHL seeks to estop him from dealing with one of his primary assets, albeit
one he owns only as a tenant-in-common.
[32]          
On the facts of this particular case, LHL’s
motion for an interim injunction is dismissed.
[33]          
In light of my findings, particularly in respect
of the irreparable harm test, this is also not an appropriate case in which to
grant any of the additional or alternative relief sought by LHL, as set out in
paragraphs 2-12 of the Notice of Motion.
[34]          
If the parties are unable to agree on the costs
of this motion, they may reach out to my judicial assistant, Nicole Anderson (nicole.anderson@ontario.ca), to
arrange a short costs hearing via Zoom.
[35]          
If it assists the parties in reaching a
consensus, I anticipate awarding costs to Avtansh in the vicinity of $3,500. 
Of course, this position is imparted without being apprised of any offers to
settle the motion.
