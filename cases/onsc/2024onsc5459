[1]              
A jury convicted N.G. of 13 sexual offences against
his four biological daughters over a period of approximately two decades
(approximately between 2001 to 2019).
[2]              
The sexual activity included touching of the
genital areas of the daughters, invitation to touch the genital areas of N.G
and fellatio.  N.G. is a 59-year-old first offender.  He is before the court
for sentencing.
[3]              
N.G. lived with his wife and six children in the
community.  N.G. married in 1989.
[4]              
The eldest daughter, J.G., moved out of the
family home in 2009.  She was not one of the victims.
[5]              
R.G. is the second daughter and a victim.
[6]              
B.G. is the third daughter and a victim.
[7]              
S.G. is the fourth daughter and a victim.  She
moved out of the family home on October 31, 2016 and then moved to Australia
where she now resides.
[8]              
The fifth child is a son and is not a victim.
[9]              
A.G. is the youngest daughter and a victim.
[10]          
In a jury trial, s. 724(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, requires the court to do the following:
[11]          
In R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1
S.C.R. 96, at paras. 14-15, the Supreme Court of Canada set out two principles.
The first principle is most relevant in this case: “First, the sentencing judge
“is bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s
verdict”:  R. v. Brown, 1991 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 518,
p. 523. The sentencing judge “shall accept as
proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict
of guilty” (Criminal Code, s.
724(2)(a)), and must not accept as fact any evidence
consistent  only with a verdict rejected by the jury: Brown; R. v. Braun (1995), 1995 CanLII 16075 (MB CA), 95  C.C.C. (3d)
443 (Man. C.A.)”: at para. 14.
[12]          
I will deal with each of the 13 convictions and
refer to them as they appear on the indictment.
[13]          
This count involved the sexual assault of A.G.
between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021.
[14]          
The jury had two paths to conviction on this
count.
[15]          
One path to conviction involved N.G. groping
A.G. in the family home. The other path involved N.G. groping A.G. on the
family’s All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV).
[16]          
The Crown argued that there is no difference in
moral blameworthiness whether the groping occurred in the home or on the ATV.
[17]          
I agree.  Both paths to conviction involve
groping and this was the gravamen of the offence. Both paths involve an intrusion
of personal space.
[18]          
On the first path to conviction, the incidents
took place in the family home.
[19]          
A.G. would have been between 12 to 18
years old when N.G. would grope her on the bottom or “butt”
every time he passed her in the home.
[20]          
When A.G. was in the kitchen doing dishes, N.G. would
come behind her and grope her butt on his way to the bathroom.  He would grab, tap,
and squeeze her bottom.
[21]          
Also, anytime she was in close proximity, he
would make a hand motion towards her bottom.
[22]          
On the second path to conviction, the incidents
took place on the family’s ATV.
[23]          
A.G. testified that every time she drove the ATV
with N.G. sitting behind her on the same seat, he would cup her breasts.
[24]          
She stated that it happened between grades 5 and
8.  She would be in the front seat driving the family’s ATV and N.G. would sit
behind her.  He would always cup her breasts.
[25]          
She said it happened under 10 times.
[26]          
When this ATV was replaced with a side-to-side
ATV, this touching no longer happened.
[27]          
In conclusion, this count involved N.G. groping
and touching A.G.’s genital areas when in close proximity with N.G.
[28]          
There were two paths to conviction on this
count.
[29]          
One path to conviction involved N.G. touching
A.G. in bed while naked.  The other path involved N.G. asking A.G. to scratch
his feet and then asking her to go “higher and higher” on his leg towards his
genital area.
[30]          
There is a higher blameworthiness for the incidents
involving touching in a bed while naked.
[31]          
On the first path to conviction, with respect to
the incidents involved N.G. touching A.G. in bed while naked, A.G. recalled sleeping with N.G. in his bed on two occasions.
[32]          
The first occasion occurred between 2011 and
2016 when she was between 8 and 13 years old.  She remembered that her mother was away on a scrapbooking weekend,
and she slept with N.G. in his bed.  A.G. testified that she woke up and she
was between N.G.’s legs.  He was naked. She stated that her parents always
slept naked.
[33]          
She recalled another incident after her mother
had a stroke in 2016 and her grandparents were visiting from England.  Her
grandparents were sleeping in her parents’ bedroom in the basement at the
family home on Laurentian Street. (Laurentian home)
[34]          
She recalled being with N.G. in her bunkbed. She
believed that N.G. was naked as he usually slept naked.  She was wearing a
nightdress.  They were both on their sides.  Her back was on his frontal side. 
She said they were “spooning”.  She felt his erection poking on her lower back.
 She did not see his penis but knew what a penis was.  He did not touch her
anywhere else.  When this happened, she was not sleeping.  She just stayed
there and did not move and fell asleep.
[35]          
On the second path to conviction, the incidents
involved A.G. scratching N.G.’s feet and scratching “higher and higher” until
she reached N.G.’s genital area.
[36]          
A.G. scratched N.G.’s feet because his feet were very dry due to
them being constantly wet while working in logging.  At times,
he asked her to scratch “higher and higher” until she reached his genital area.
[37]          
Regarding frequency, on cross-examination, A.G. could
not estimate the number of times she did this as it was “too frequent”.  She
also may have received money for it.
[38]          
These feet scratching incidents occurred in his
bedroom and basement living room at the Laurentian home.
[39]          
In recalling the one time when they were in his
bedroom, she testified that he was naked under a cover and laying on his
stomach.  She recalled grazing her fingers inside of his thighs and scratching
in his genital area.
[40]          
On examination-in-chief, A.G. said that “as soon
as I reached that area, he would stop saying ‘higher and higher’”.  On
cross-examination, she said she did not touch N.G.’s penis and only her fingers
and knuckles grazed his testicles.
[41]          
She recalled another time in the basement living
room.  S.G. and her brother J.G. were also present, sitting on other seats.  A.G.
and N.G. were on the couch.  He was lying down and she was sitting up.  He had
one leg on her lap.
[42]          
 He was wearing only underwear and was under a
duvet.
[43]          
 On examination-in-chief, she said she started
scratching N.G.’s feet without him asking as she said it was expected.  She
would scratch his feet with her nails.  She moved up his legs to his inner
thigh area.
[44]          
She moved up to his genital area and touched him
outside his underwear. On this occasion, he did not ask A.G. to go “higher and
higher”, she just knew what was expected.  She scratched his inner thighs and
her knuckles happened to brush up against his testicles.
[45]          
In determining the facts of this count for
sentencing purposes, the court is guided by R. v. N.F., 1994 ABCA 402, 162
A.R. 117, where the sentencing judge was uncertain as to whether the act of
sexual assault that formed the basis of the guilty verdict was fellatio, sexual
intercourse or touching.  The Court of Appeal of Alberta, at para. 10, reviewed
the sentencing judge’s reasoning:
[46]          
Upon its review, the Court of Appeal of Alberta
did not overturn the sentencing judge on his findings for the purpose of
sentencing.  However, at paras. 17-18, the court referred to some relevant
caselaw:
[47]          
There were no questions from the jury on this
issue.
[48]          
I note that, except for count 11, N.G. was not
otherwise convicted on any incidents involving his bed or the victim’s bed.
[49]          
The jury did not find any offences involving
N.G. sleeping with the victims in their beds or doing bed checks.
[50]          
The jury acquitted N.G. on count 1, where A.G.
alleged that when she was between 4 to 5 years old, N.G. put A.G. on his bed
and placed his penis on her pubic bone area.  This incident involved a bed.
[51]          
The jury also acquitted N.G. on count 25, involving
N.G. doing bed checks, which required him to go upstairs to R.G.’s bedroom.  These
incidents also involved a bed.
[52]          
However, on count 3, the jury convicted N.G. on
counts that involved him groping A.G.
[53]          
Further, as discussed below, the court finds
that the count 24 path to conviction involved N.G. being sexually inappropriate
against R.G. in the living room rather than being sexually inappropriate in
R.G.’s bed.
[54]          
Thus, on count 4,  the court shall accept as
proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict
of guilty that the jury found that N.G. touched A.G. inappropriately, but not
in a bed.
[55]          
That is, the court finds that this count deals
with the incidents where N.G. asked A.G. to scratch his feet and then asked her
to go “higher and higher” on his legs towards his genital area.
[56]          
There is only one path to conviction.
[57]          
The count occurred when B.G. was between 10 and
11 years old and N.G. asked her to put his penis in her mouth and told her to
put her tongue at the end of it and suck.  She testified that she remembered
that the penis was erect, and he was not wearing pants.  She stated that for
longest time, she thought penises looked like that: i.e., erect. She remembers
swallowing a bit but does not know if N.G. ejaculated.
[58]          
This count involved fellatio. There is only one
path to conviction.
[59]          
When she was 10 or 11 years old (circa 2005 to
2006), B.G. testified that N.G. asked her to put his penis in her mouth and
told her to put her tongue at the end of it and suck. He was not wearing pants.
 He asked her if she had ever seen a penis before and that it was okay to see a
penis as it was her father’s penis.  She did what he asked and remembered the
penis being erect.
[60]          
For the longest time, she thought penises looked
like that, that is: erect.
[61]          
After the incident, she left the bedroom in the
basement and went to watch television.
[62]          
She remembered swallowing a lot but does not
know if he ejaculated.
[63]          
This count is stayed by R. v. Kineapple,
1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 as it has a similar factual nexus as count 11. See also
See R. v. Prince, [1986] S.C.R. 480; R. v. S.J.M., 2009
ONCA 244, 247 O.A.C. 178.
[64]          
This count relates to the same allegation as in count 10.  This count involved N.G. kissing B.G. who woke up with N.G.’s tongue
in her mouth.
[65]          
There was only one path to conviction on this
count.
[66]          
This incident would have occurred
between 2001 and 2007 when B.G. would have been between 5 and 12 years old.
The evidence for this count relates to B.G.’s allegation that N.G. kissed her
and had his tongue in her mouth.
[67]          
This count is stayed by Kineapple as it has a similar
factual nexus as count 16.
[68]          
This count involved N.G. touching S.G.’s vagina when
they were on the couch in the living room.
[69]          
There was only one path to conviction on this count.
[70]          
S.G. would have been between 5 and 16 years old.
[71]          
S.G. testified that she would be on the couch with N.G. and they would
have a blanket over them.  He would be sitting on the other side of the couch.
[72]          
While sitting on the couch, N.G. scratched her feet and would go up her
legs until he touched her vagina. She would be wearing shorts, maybe a dress,
and underwear.
[73]          
N.G. would put his fingers on the side of her leg, get into her underwear
and put his fingers so that he could touch her vagina. She said sometimes the
touching would be over the underwear, but most times, it would occur under the
underwear.
[74]          
There was only one path to conviction on this count.
[75]          
S.G. would have been between 13 and 15 years old.
[76]          
S.G. described giving N.G. a “hand job” in exchange for N.G. allowing
her to have her nose pierced.  She said it would have been before she was 16
years of age as otherwise, she would have been able to do it without parental
consent.
[77]          
She stated that N.G. initially asked her to give him a back rub.  He was
lying on his stomach, and she rubbed his back.  He told her to go “lower and
lower”.  He then turned over on his back and told her to rub his penis.
[78]          
N.G. remembered S.G. asking for a nose piercing and in court, expressed his
concern of permanency of tattoos and piercing for young people, but denied this
incident.
[79]          
This count is stayed by Kineapple as it has a similar
factual nexus to count 18.
[80]          
This count involved N.G. touching S.G. while she sat on
his lap in N.G.’s pick-up truck.
[81]          
There was only one path to conviction on this count.
[82]          
This count relates to S.G.’s allegation that when she was driving the
truck, she sat on her father’s lap and he touched her on her leg, back, side
and chest, and at times, on her inner thighs.  She said she has a specific
memory of him touching on her back and going around her chest and then shoulder
area and then to the middle of the chest.  She did not recall him touching her
breasts.
[83]          
This count is intertwined with counts 24 and 25, which adds complexity
to determining the facts.
[84]          
There were two paths to conviction on this count.
[85]          
One path to conviction involves N.G. touching R.G.’s labia, but not
penetrating, when R.G. was on the La-Z-Boy chair with him. The other path to
conviction involves N.G. doing bed checks at night where he
would tug off R.G.’s pants and underwear and bra and would touch her breasts, vagina
and side areas.
[86]          
Count 24 deals with N.G. touching R.G.’s labia on the La-Z-Boy
chair.
[87]          
The jury acquitted N.G. on count 25 (sexual assault) which involved touching
while N.G. completed bed checks.
[88]          
Thus, the court finds that count 23 deals with R.G. inappropriately
touching N.G. on the La-Z-Boy chair.
[89]          
Therefore, count 23 is stayed by Kineapple
as it has a similar factual nexus as count 24.
[90]          
This count involved N.G. touching R.G.’s labia when R.G. sat on
N.G.’s lap in the family’s La-Z-Boy chair.  R.G. alleged that N.G. would touch
and trace her vagina and labia area.
[91]          
R.G. would have been between 6 and 14 years old.
[92]          
At a pre-sentencing case conference hearing, the
defence objected to the admission of R.G.’s VIS on the basis that it offended
the parameters of the provisions of s. 722 of the Code.  In her VIS, R.G.
described her sentiments of her father as a parent, her home life, criticized
the legal process and made recommendations on sentencing. In addition, R.G.
made a litany of complaints against N.G., described
her resentment and discussed uncharged conduct of N.G.
[93]          
At that time, the court asked the Crown to
determine whether R.G. was prepared to revise her VIS in accordance with the
directions set out in the form and focus on what impact
the offences had on her.
[94]          
At the sentencing hearing,
the Crown advised that R.G. was not prepared to revise her VIS. The Crown submitted that pursuant to s. 722 of the Code, the court
must consider the VIS, allow R.G. to read it in court if she so wishes and ignore
irrelevant portions of the VIS.
[95]          
After hearing full submissions, the court
admitted R.G.’s VIS for written reasons to follow.
[96]          
These are my reasons.
[97]          
The court as the gatekeeper is guided by s. 722
of the Code when determining what evidence it will consider.
[98]          
The court recognizes that considering the impact
the offences have had on victims is an important part of the process in
sentencing.
[99]          
The Code also  requires that the court
only consider what is necessary for the purposes of sentencing.  In addition,
the court is mandated to hear from the victim if she chooses to read her VIS in
court.
[100]      
The court can disabuse itself of any information
that is not relevant when it makes a determination of sentence, including uncharged
conduct, recommendation of sentencing and other alleged conduct against N.G.—
all of which is not relevant for sentencing.
[101]      
 The court has recognized this principle and so
therefore it is important that the court consider the effect of the offences on
R.G.  As will be discussed and explained below, the court has only considered
that part of R.G.’s VIS as it relates to the effect N.G.’s offences have had on
her.
[102]      
This will ensure that a proper and fair
sentencing hearing of N.G. takes place.
[103]      
Each victim spoke about their
deep feelings of hurt and the serious impact these offences has had on them.
They all explained the familial isolation between themselves and the other
members of the family.
[104]      
A.G. read her VIS in court. A.G. experienced
shame as a young girl and wondered why she felt weird when hugged by her
father.  She noticed other friends who had a good relationship with their fathers,
and this made her hurt, jealous and angry.  Her sense of security has been
shattered and ruined.  She felt ashamed about what her father was doing to her.
 It impacted her ability to focus on her studies.  She felt shame and anger in
her home.  Even though the disclosure of the offences was made, the emotional
and psychological pain continued.  She was estranged from her mother who did
not believe her and she was made to feel that she was responsible for tearing
the family apart.  Her anger has taken over and it causes neck pains and chest
pains.  She is tense every day.  She has restless sleep with terrible dreams
and does not wake up refreshed.  She has distorted feelings about herself.  She
resents the fact that she has so much pain caused by N.G.  She has taken
therapy.  She continues to suffer the pain as she lives in the same community
and when she sees her family members, they ignore her.  She feels she has no
support system from her family.  Her loss of self includes the loss of being a
sister, aunt and daughter.  In her final words, she says N.G. ruined her
childhood, took her privacy and safety, destroyed her self-esteem and poisoned
her relationship with her family.
[105]      
B.G.’s VIS was filed but not read in court.  She
states that this was her first big trauma in her life.  When the abuse was happening,
she let it happen so she could feel some sort of love.  Now, she has
difficulties being loved and feels unlovable.  When she discovered the abuse
was wrong, she became a detached person.  She could not tell anyone, so she
kept the weight of what had happened.  She was afraid to say anything as it
could break up the family and remove the sole income earner, i.e., N.G.  She
coped by trying to block the abuse from her mind and pretend it was someone
else or it was not happening.  She became distracted and unable to focus with
the task at hand.  She too has lost the family connections to her mother,
brother, sisters, nieces and extended family.
[106]      
S.G. read her VIS remotely.  S.G. stated that
these offences had such a great impact that she fled the country nearly eight
years ago.  She avoided returning home and did it only once.  She has a
severely strained relationship with her family and has not spoken to many
members of her family.  The familial strained relationship will always be
damaged.  She experiences a sense of loss which includes the loss of comfort
and support from her family.  She continues to struggle emotionally and
mentally and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.  She has sought
help from a psychologist and has had out-of-pocket expenses for therapy and
anti-depressants.  The trial process has taken its toll on her as she had to
testify in early mornings (Australian time) and at the same time, perform her
job responsibilities.  This has led to panic attacks, stress leave and sleepless
nights.  This has impacted on her sense of safety, her mental health and her
family relationships.  She sums it up for her as follows: “It is an absolute
tragedy to be born as a female in the family of N.G. and A.G.” (A.G. here is
referring to the wife of N.G.).
[107]      
R.G. was also angry and bitter that she cannot
continue to be an aunt.  She feels the familial isolation.  She states she
struggles with her emotions, and she feels hurt, angry and depressed.  She
refers to the text that N.G. wrote “sorry” and demands an explanation.  The loss
of her sibling relationship has impacted her.  She is very disappointed by her
mother constantly letting her down and that her mother chose her husband over
her daughter.  She grew up struggling with her emotions and feeling sad, angry,
hurt and depressed as she began to realize N.G.’s conduct was not normal.  She
was disappointed that she had not received education or guidance about
molestation at an early age so she would have known.  It has been “scary” for
her to admit that she has been molested.  As a child, she would lay awake and
cry and wondered what she had done to deserve this life.
[108]      
As stated above, the court has ignored
irrelevant sections from R.G.’s VIS, including her complaints on uncharged
conduct of N.G., criticisms of N.G. not relevant to the sentence and her
recommendation for sentence.
[109]      
N.G. is a 59-year-old first offender.
[110]      
He continues to maintain his innocence and
expresses shock.  He does not understand why his daughters would say these
things about him.
[111]      
He has been married for approximately 35 years
and reports a happy and healthy relationship.
[112]      
Some collaterals stated that N.G. was a caring
and supporting husband.  They described him as a hard-working, even-tempered
quiet and private man.  He would be willing to give his shirt off his back and be
willing to help his neighbours.
[113]      
Other collaterals said there was arguing and
anger in the home and manipulation and emotional abuse, with little love and
nurturing.
[114]      
N.G. attended a local college to study forestry,
has maintained employment and recently has become self-employed operating a
forestry business with his son.  He was a volunteer firefighter for 20 years
until 2017.
[115]      
In the report, N.G. stated that he had a loving
and caring relationship with his wife. Throughout the years, they had financial
difficulties and he had to declare bankruptcy in 2018. However, they enjoyed the
“simplicity of being at home” and spending time with their family, including with
their children and grandchildren.  Much of his time has been spent working and
being with his family.  They do not have close friends.
[116]      
After his wife suffered a massive stroke in 2016
and spent three months in the hospital, he became her caregiver and ensured
that her needs were met.  His wife does not believe the offences took place.
[117]      
In 2021, they moved into his childhood home to
take care of his mother who was suffering from failing health.  His mother
passed away in 2023.
[118]      
He has a close relationship with his son and his
eldest daughter J.G. who has three children.
[119]      
He seldom drinks alcohol and does not take
drugs.
[120]      
He does not take responsibility for the
allegations before the court and says that he was in shock when the police
arrested him.
[121]      
During his interview with the probation officer
preparing the Pre-Sentence Report,  N.G. displayed little emotion other than
when he spoke about his daughters.  He teared up saying that he loved them and
hoped time would heal.
[122]      
All victims asked for a non-contact order,
except B.G. and A.G., who have asked for an exception to be permitted to
provide written revocable contact should they someday choose to have contact.
[123]      
The Sexual Behaviours Assessment Report dated
April 8, 2024 was authored by Dr. Jonathan Gray, who is a Clinical Director at
the Brockville Forensic Treatment Unit as well as a psychiatrist at the Royal
Ottawa Health Care Group
[124]      
Dr. Gray met with N.G. and, among other things,
reviewed the police synopsis of the charges, witness’ statements, some of the
trial exhibits and the show cause hearing report.
[125]      
N.G. indicated that his relationship with all
the children was “great” up until he was charged. He had a close relationship
with B.G. because of her positive attitude and had a more difficult relationship
with R.G. because she was negative and rebellious.
[126]      
He denied the offences but admitted that he
asked his children to rub his feet as his feet were wet from work and therefore
dry and cracked.  He admitted that he had S.G. sit on his lap in the driver’s
seat when she was learning to drive, but denied groping her breasts.
[127]      
He sent a “sorry” text to his daughters because
he was in an anxious state of mind and felt overwhelmed when the allegations
first surfaced.  It was not an admission of guilt.
[128]      
He denied suffering from any major depression,
low moods, suffering from problems with sleeping or appetite or suicidal
thoughts.
[129]      
 N.G. self-reported that he never struggled with
low mood anxiety or sleep problems prior to these charges.  He denied anxiety
disorders or experiencing any psychotic symptoms.  He has not had any suicidal
attempts.
[130]      
As a volunteer firefighter, he was twice exposed
to fatalities.  He participated in some group counseling after one particular incident
when he found corpses in a burnt house.
[131]      
He has the following health issues:
hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia for which he takes medication.
[132]      
Regarding sexual history, he denied being
sexually abused and confirmed he has only had one sexual partner in his life:
his wife.  He said his sex drive is low and thought about sex once a month.
[133]      
In his self-reported psychological questionnaire
and various tests, Dr. Gray found that N.G.:
[134]      
Phallometric testing is an objective measure of
physiological sexual arousal to videotapes, slides and audiotapes depicting
various sexual scenarios and sexual partners.
[135]      
N.G. underwent this testing and he was
classified as a “low responder” as he did not demonstrate clinical sexual
arousal to any stimulus presented to him.  A sexual preference pattern could not
be established.  This testing does not add evidence for or against the
hypothesis that N.G. may have a sexual interest in young girls.
[136]      
The Static-99 is a widely-used sex offender risk
assessment instrument designed to assist in the prediction of sexual and
violent recidivism for sexual offenders.
[137]      
On this assessment, N.G. was found in the lowest
of five ascending risk categories for a sexual or violent re-offence at a “very
low” relative risk.
[138]      
The STABLE-2007 measures empirical risk factors
that are routinely addressed as part of correctional rehabilitation (i.e.,
criminogenic needs) for adult males convicted of sexual offences against a
child.
[139]      
Based on his interview, Dr. Gray assigned N.G. a
score of 4 out of possible 26 points on the STABLE-2007, which would place him
in the moderate density range of criminogenic needs. Out of 100 individuals in
the study sample convicted of a sexual offence, 22 would have a lower score, 10
would have the same score and 68 would have a higher score than N.G.
[140]      
In his opinion, Dr. Gray found no disorder in
mood, substance use, psychotic, anxiety or trauma categories of the Diagnostic
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
[141]      
On page 22 of the report, Dr. Gray notes that N.G.
denied the offences.  He notes that the bulk of the incidents occurred when the
daughters were clearly pre-pubescent or possibly early puberty and that the
offences slowed down when they went through puberty.  Dr. Gray indicates that
“I do not think family dynamics alone can explain his behaviour.  A diagnosis
of an underlying pedophilic disorder must be a primary motivating factor.”
[142]      
In summary, Dr. Gray opines that N.G. is at low
risk to re-offend as only 5.4% of convicted sexual offenders in the category
similar to N.G. committed another sexual offence within five years of release from
incarceration.
[143]      
The three dynamic risk factors are: evidence of
deviant sexual interests based on the demographics and number of victims; the
fact that N.G.’s support network enables his denial of his conduct; and N.G.’s tendency
to move on from problems rather than acknowledge and correct them, at least in
the case of his index behaviour.
[144]      
Given his scores, Dr. Gray states that N.G. will
not likely be offered any treatment by Correctional Service of Canada when serving
a federal penitentiary term.  Further, there is little benefit for him to
attend sexual offender treatment given that he is a low-risk re-offender.
[145]      
Rather than treatment, the report emphasizes a
risk management strategy to reduce or eliminate opportunities for him to be in
a situation where he could form relationships with pre-pubescent females and be
alone with them.  There should be risk mitigation strategies upon N.G.’s release
to prevent him from having unsupervised contact with underaged females.
[146]      
Dr. Gray recommends no unsupervised contact with
females under the age of 18 unless with supervision.  He is not sure that J.G,
the mother of the granddaughters would be appropriate as a supervisor, as she
believes her father did not commit the offences.
[147]      
He opines that there is a long-lasting trauma
for the victims given that N.G. was in a position of trust and that they have
not had the support from the rest of the family.
[148]      
N.G faces 9 convictions of sexual abuse of his four
biological daughters over a lengthy period. The Crown requests 16 years in total as a sentence which represents 4 years
consecutive for each of the victims.
[149]      
The Crown submits that deterrence and
denunciation of sexual crimes against children should be the guiding sentencing
principle.
[150]      
With respect to A.G.:
[151]      
With respect to B.G.:
[152]      
With respect to S.G.:
[153]      
With respect to R.G.:
[154]      
The following ancillary orders are requested:
[155]      
An order pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Code
for N.G. to provide a DNA sample as N.G. committed a primary designated offence.
[156]      
An order pursuant to s. 490.012 for N.G. to
comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c.
10 for life as N.G. has committed two or more designated offences and there is
a pattern; otherwise, for 20 years.
[157]      
A mandatory firearms prohibition pursuant to s.
109 for 10 years.
[158]      
A prohibition pursuant to s. 161 preventing N.G.
from seeking employment or volunteering positions where there would be persons
under 16 years of age, unless under the supervision of another adult.
[159]      
A non-contact order pursuant to s. 743.21 with
the four victims and N.R. (B.G.’s partner).
[160]      
With respect to A.G. and B.G., the non-contact
order will be revocable with their written consent.
[161]      
The defence submits that the court should impose
a 9-year sentence; 3 for each of the counts as against S.G., B.G. and R.G., and
the counts against A.G. should run concurrent given the similarity of facts to the
other counts.
[162]      
The defence argues that the provision s. 718.3 (7)
in Code that directs that when the court imposes a sentence of
imprisonment for a sexual offence against one child, that the term of
imprisonment imposed for another child must be served consecutively. This
provision was not in force at the time most of these offences and cannot be
applied retroactively but only prospectively. The Crown agrees.
[163]      
R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424 confirms
that children are our future and some of the most vulnerable members. Children are
entitled to have a childhood free of sexual violence: at para. 1.
[164]      
At para. 114, the Supreme Court of Canada’s message
is that “mid-single digit penitentiary terms for sexual offences against
children are normal and the upper-single digit and double-digit penitentiary
terms should be neither unusual nor reserved for rare or exceptional
circumstances.”
[165]      
At para. 130, the Court emphasized that “all
other things being equal, an offender who abuses a position of trust to commit
a sexual offence against a child should receive a lengthier sentence than an offender
who is a stranger to the child”.  Referring to various articles, the Court commented
that there has been criticism of “the tendency of courts to impose similar
sentences on strangers and fathers for sexual offences against children,
despite the fact that sexual assaults by fathers are more likely to occur on
multiple occasions”.
[166]      
At para. 131, the Court stated that “[t]he
frequency and duration [of sexual violence] can significantly increase the harm
to the victim. The immediate harm the victim experiences during the assault is
multiplied by the number of assaults.  Moreover, the long-term emotional and
psychological harm to the victim can also become more pronounced where the
sexual violence is repeated and prolonged.”
[167]      
At para. 133, the Court summarized this point as
follows: “In sum, sexual violence against children that is committed on
multiple occasions and for longer periods of time should attract significantly
higher sentences that reflect the full cumulative gravity of the crime.”
[168]      
The Crown has provided the following cases for
the court’s consideration.
[169]      
In R. v. T.J., 2021 ONCA 392, at paras.
26-27, the Court of Appeal for Ontario overturned a sentence of 9 months and
imposed a 24-month jail term.
[170]      
The offender was charged with sexual interference,
invitation to sexual touching, and sexual assault against C.M., a child. The
offences occurred on one occasion in 2010 or 2011 when C.M. and her brother
were at the offender’s home for a sleepover with his sons. At the time, C.M.
was 6 or 7 years old.
[171]      
The offender directed C.M. to the bathroom and
to put her hands on the offender’s penis, asking her to rub it and telling how
to do it. This went on for a few minutes; the respondent then told C.M. that
she could put her mouth on his penis.  At that point, C.M. pulled away and left
the room.
[172]      
The court reiterated, at para. 26, citing R
v. Lis, 2020 ONCA 551, at para. 55, that “[a] sentence expresses
denunciation by condemning ‘the offender for encroaching on our society’s basic
code of values’; it expresses deterrence by ‘discouraging the offender and
others from engaging in criminal conduct’. Considerations of general deterrence
led to an offender being punished more severely than he or she might otherwise
deserve in order to send a message to others.”
[173]      
At para. 27, the court referred to s. 718.01 of
the Code which confirms that denunciation and deterrence must be the
primary objectives of the sentence.  However, “it is no longer open to a
sentencing judge to elevate other sentencing objectives, for example
rehabilitation, to equivalent or greater priority than denunciation and
deterrence in determining a proportionate sentence. These other objectives may
be given significant weight, but not priority or equivalency”: at para. 27,
citing Lis, at paras. 47-48, 53; Friesen, at paras. 101-104.
[174]      
In R. v. J.C., 2021 O.J. No. 7396, the offender
was charged with offences involving his 14-year-old niece on 3 separate
incidents.  First, when the offender slapped the victim’s buttocks.  Second, when
the offender performed a massage on the victim without the victim’s consent, and
the offender unhooked the victim’s bra and travelled his hands around her body.
 And third, when the offender grabbed the victim’s breasts from behind and went
under her shirt to touch her breasts (while she was not wearing a bra).  She
could feel his erect penis and he also groped her vaginal area.
[175]      
At para. 16, the court emphasized the important
objective of protecting children from wrongful exploitation which interferes
with sexual integrity.  At para 17, the court set out some of the factors that
should be considered in cases involving sexual offences against children:
[176]      
In R. v. G.R., 2020 ONSC 7411, the
offender was charged for 3 incidents against the 9-year-old child of the
offender’s partner.  First, while the victim was on his lap and he rubbed her vagina.
 Second, while he was on the floor trying to hold the victim, he manipulated
her nipples and put his lip on her ear.  Third, he went through the victim’s shorts
and underwear and touched her vagina with his finger.  He rubbed his penis against
her and put her vagina near his penis.  His penis was in and out of his pants. 
He was a 50-year-old first offender and gainfully employed. The court imposed a
sentence of 5.5 years.
[177]      
In R. v. J.H., 2022 ONCJ 271, the offender was charged for 4 or 5 incidents against
the offender’s 10-year-old biological daughter.  He was a 30-year-old first
offender who had been abused himself as a child.  He was sentenced to 4 years,
concurrent on each count.
[178]      
In R. v. H. K., [2022] O.J. No. 6144, the
offender was charged for 3 incidents against his biological daughter when she
was 8 to 10 years old.  These incidents included incidents of him rubbing his
penis against her buttocks.  He touched her vagina over and under her clothing
and hugged and kissed her.  Once in bed, she felt his penis on her bare
buttocks.  He was a first offender.  He was sentenced to 6 years.
[179]      
In R. v. P.R., 2024 ONCJ 200, the
offender was found guilty of 8 counts against 3 victims: his daughter and two
nieces between 5 to 16 years old.  The assaults involved kissing, licking and touching
the victims’ chests and vaginas, and with two of the victims, the offender had
them stroke or suck his penis.  The total sentence was 10 years.
[180]      
In R. v. J.W., 2022 ONSC 6491, the
offender was convicted of 2 counts of sexual offences against two children under
the age of 16 years: his stepdaughter and her friend.  The offender had no
criminal record, was 35 years old, completely lacked insight, denied the charges
and the probation officer expressed concern of likelihood of reoffending.  The
court imposed a sentence of 10 years.
[181]      
In R. v. J.T., 2021 ONSC 366, the case involved the offender’s historical sexual
abuse of his three young stepdaughters over 8 years, including forced vaginal,
oral and anal intercourse many times each week.  He was a 50-year-old first
offender. The court imposed a 16-year sentence.
[182]      
In R. v. Cunningham, 2024 ONCJ
295, the offender pled guilty to 2 counts of sexual assault of a person under
the age of 16 years, making possessing and accessing child sexual abuse
material and breaching a SOIRA order.  He did not accept responsibility
and was designated a dangerous offender.  He preyed on single mothers to gain
their trust and offend their children.  He was sentenced to 18 years
imprisonment.
[183]      
The defence has provided the following cases.
[184]      
In R. v. D.D. (2002), 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 58 O.R. (3d) 788
(C.A.), the offender was convicted of involved 11 sexual offences against four
boys between 4 to 8 years old.  The case involved a breach of trust situation
and the sexual offences involved anal intercourse, physical violence and threat
of violence, which included holding one victim over a 30th floor balcony.  He
accepted responsibility.  The court upheld a sentence of 9 years and 1 month.
[185]      
In R. v. Denis Guindon, 2020 ONSC 6065, the
offender had no criminal record and was at low risk to re-offend.  He received
7 years for indecent assault as he attempted to anally penetrate a child, 7
years concurrent for sexual assault concurrent and 3 years concurrent for
buggery. He was in a position of trust, the victim was a child, the offences
occurred over a period of time, the victim was groomed and the offender was
part of a foster family.  He threatened the victim that he would be moved to
another foster home if he told anyone of the offences.
[186]      
In R. v. S.C., 2019 ONCA 199, 145 O.R.
(3d) 711, the accused touched and photographed sleeping toddlers’ genitals
while they slept in a day care where he was employed.  He collected child
pornography.  He received 6 years for 8 counts of sexual assault, 1-year
consecutive for 8 counts of making child pornography and 2 years for possession
of child pornography consecutive. The court referred to the totality principle
when dealing with child pornography offences along with sexual offences.
[187]      
In R. v. Stuckless, 2019 ONCA 504, 142
O.R. (3d) 752, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal and imposed a
10-year sentence in a case where the accused had sexually abused 18 young boys
over a period of 20 years while in a position of trust.  The court found that
the sentencing judge erred in imposing 6.5 years for 102 counts of sexual offences
even though the accused was at a low risk to re-offend.  The sexual abuse
involved sexual touching, digital penetration and fellatio.
[188]      
In R. v. D.F., 2024 ONSC 1892, a 59-year-old
first offender was convicted of sexual assault, sexual interference and
invitation to sexual touching of a victim (niece by marriage) when the victim was
between 6 and 10 years old.  The sexual activity included touching of the
victim’s vaginal area over and under clothing, fellatio, cunnilingus and
digital penetration.  The court sentenced the offender to the following: On the
count of sexual assault, the count was stayed. On the count of sexual
interference, 4 years. On the count of invitation to sexual touching, 1 year,
concurrent.
[189]      
The sentence must be proportionate to the
gravity of the offence and degree of responsibility of the offender: Criminal
Code, s. 718.1.
[190]      
The court is mindful of the parity principle,
that is, a sentence imposed for an offence should be
similar to similar offences committed by similar offenders in similar
circumstances.
[191]      
Since N.G.’s sexual offences are against
children, the court must give primary consideration to the objectives of
denunciation and deterrence: Criminal Code, s. 718.01.
[192]      
Other sentencing principles are set out in s.
718.2 of the Code.
[193]      
Specifically, s. 718.2(a) sets out aggravating
circumstances that must considered, including:
[194]      
The aggravating factors are as follows:
[195]      
The mitigating factors are as follows:
[196]      
Further, N.G.’s denial of the offences and
taking responsibility for offences, make it less likely that he would benefit
from counselling. The Sexual Behaviours Assessment Report also indicates that
he would not be a good candidate for counselling as he is shown as a low risk to
re-offend.
[197]      
Rehabilitation does not factor significantly in
this case.
[198]      
This case involves four biological children with
some of the offences commencing at a very early age.
[199]      
Most of the offences occurred in the privacy of
their own home, where the children should have felt safe and secure.
[200]      
The court has considered the number of times the
offence occurred and the length of time the offence occurred (i.e., approximately
two decades).
[201]      
Given the offences, the rehabilitation principle
is not a prominent factor.
[202]      
Further, the lack of sexual penetration does not
mitigate the sexual offences with respect to children.
[203]      
In cases such as these, penitentiary sentences
are the norm absent some exceptional circumstances.  There are no exceptional
circumstances here.
[204]      
As stated in R. v. M.M., 2022 ONCA 441,
the Court of Appeal for Ontario acknowledged that sentences for sexual offences
against children have been “too low for too long”: at para. 15. Again, the
court emphasized that denunciation and deterrence are of primary importance in
these types of offences.
[205]      
As stated above, I note the following when
fashioning a fit sentence:
[206]      
As the Supreme Court of
Canada explained in Friesen, a breach of trust is likely to
increase the harm to the victim and the gravity of the offence: at paras.
125-26.
[207]      
This breach of trust is a
significant aggravating factor.
[208]      
While growing up, the
victims felt pressure not to say anything, especially B.G., who did not want to
be the one to tear the family apart if she disclosed the abuse.
[209]      
The four victims were robbed
of some of their childhood.
[210]      
The victims’ VIS outline the
anxiety and confusion by the way they were abused by their father when they
were growing up.
[211]      
A.G. was frequently subjected
to the groping of breasts and her bottom. She was also told to scratch his N.G.’s
feet and go “higher and higher” so that she grazed N.G.’s genitals.
[212]      
B.G. had to perform fellatio
and she experienced N.G. kissing her and placing his tongue in her mouth.  This
was in her bedroom where there is a high expectation of privacy.
[213]      
S.G.’s feet would be
scratched by N.G. and he would go up her legs and touch her vagina, sometimes
over or under her underwear.
[214]      
S.G. was forced to perform a
“hand job” on her father so she could have her nose pierced.
[215]      
S.G. was also groped when
she sat on her father’s lap in his truck when she was learning to drive.
[216]      
R.G.’s labia was touched by
N.G. on the La-Z-Boy chair in the living room.
[217]      
This is not the type of
upbringing that a child should have experienced.
[218]      
Notably, all the offences
involve the breach of the victim’s sexual integrity.
[219]      
I have considered all of the aggravating and
mitigating factors, the sentencing principles and the priority of denunciation
and deterrence.  Society is revulsed with the sexual abuse of children
especially when it occurs to one’s biological children and when it occurs in
one’s home where a child should feel a sense of security and well-being. 
Deterrence is important as it should send a message to all that there are
serious consequences for sexually abusing children.
[220]      
A message must also be sent to would-be
offenders that they will be severely punished for sexually abusing a child.
[221]      
 I find that the provision s. 718.3(7) of the Code
requires that the separate consecutive sentences for each of the victims should
not be applied retroactively.  This section was enacted in 2015 and most of the
offences here occurred before that date.
[222]      
However, I do not agree with the defence
position that the offences against A.G. and R.G. should attract concurrent
sentences because they take place in the same timeframe.  They are separate
offences dealing with two different victims and the impact on them has been
enormous.
[223]      
I have concluded that some of the sentences run
concurrently to ensure that the global sentence in totality is not unduly long
or harsh.
[224]      
An appropriate sentence would be 3.5 years for
each count 4, 6, 18, and 24 for a total of 14 years with the other sentences to
be served concurrently.
[225]      
However, taking into account the principle of
totality in fashioning the global sentence, I apply restraint as I am required
to do as N.G. is a first-time offender.
[226]      
The court reduces the penitentiary time to be
served to 12 years.
[227]      
Please stand up N.G.:
[228]      
N.G., you have scarred your victims, perhaps for
life.  You violated their trust as their father.
[229]      
You will be sentenced as follows:
[230]      
Count 4: 3 years prison term;
[231]      
Count 3: 2 years concurrent to Count 4;
[232]      
Count 6: 3 years prison term consecutive;
[233]      
Count 8: 3 years concurrent;
[234]      
Count 11: 2 years concurrent;
[235]      
Count 16: 3 years prison term concurrent;
[236]      
Count 18: 3 years consecutive;
[237]      
Count 20: 2 years concurrent;
[238]      
Count 24: 3 years consecutive.
[239]      
You are sentenced to 12 years in total.
[240]      
You will also be subject to the following
ancillary orders:
[241]      
You will provide a sample of
your DNA pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code, as the sexual offences are primary designated offences
[242]      
You will be required to comply with the Sex
Offender Information Registration Act pursuant to s. 490.012 for 20 years.
[243]      
There will be a mandatory weapons prohibition
pursuant to s. 109 for 10 years.
[244]      
Pursuant to s. 743.21, there will be a
non-contact order prohibiting contact between the four victims and N.G.  A.G.
and B.G. will have revocable consent in writing.  There is no evidence that a
non-contact order is necessary for S.G.’s husband and the court declines to
make such an order.
[245]      
Any contact with N.G.’s granddaughters before
they reach the age of 18 years, will be supervised by any adult, including
their mother.
[246]      
Under s. 161 of the Criminal Code, the
court has discretion to prohibit offenders who are convicted of certain sexual
offences against persons under the age of 16 from engaging in a variety of
everyday conduct upon their release, subject to any conditions or exemptions
the court considers appropriate.
[247]      
In  R. v. K.R.J., 2016
SCC 31, at para. 3, the
Supreme Court stated that for the court to impose s. 161 orders:
[248]      
Here, the court has considered that N. G.:
[249]      
Accordingly, N.G. will not
attend a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16
years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare
centre, schoolground, playground or community centre unless accompanied by an
adult for 10 years from the release from prison.
[250]      
I waive the victim fine surcharge.
