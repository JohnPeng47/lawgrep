[1]              
The Plaintiff Victoria Smith (“Ms. Smith”) brings this summary judgment
motion against the Defendant Shaun Rothberg also known as Shaun Rootenberg (“Mr.
Rootenberg”) to recover damages for breach of trust.
[2]              
Ms. Smith set this case down for trial on September 28, 2022. 
Therefore, Ms. Smith requires leave pursuant to r. 48 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure R.R.O. 1990, Reg 194 to bring this motion.
[3]              
Ms. Smith also seeks a dismissal of the action against the other
Defendants without costs because she has settled her claim against them. Mr. Rootenberg
does not consent to the dismissal of the action against the other Defendants.
[4]              
Mr. Rootenberg did not file any materials on the motion but he appeared
in person and made submissions. Mr. Rootenberg requested an adjournment because
he did not have sufficient time to prepare.
[5]              
 Ms. Smith’s motion record was served at Mr. Rootenberg’s last known
address. He acknowledged that he did receive a copy of Ms. Smith’s pre-trial
conference memorandum on November 18, 2024 which says that this matter was
scheduled for trial today. He also said that on November 21, 2024 he picked up
a copy of the motion record for today’s motion for summary judgment.
[6]              
Ms. Smith also served the motion record by email to Mr. Rootenberg because
of the Canada Post strike.
[7]              
There is no doubt that Mr. Rootenberg was validly served with the motion
record pursuant to the Rules.
[8]              
I denied Mr. Rootenberg’s request for an adjournment because he was
aware of today’s date, was validly served, said he did not intend to retain
counsel, and had no valid defence to the motion.
[9]              
Ms. Smith is granted leave to bring this motion. Ms. Smith is granted
judgment against Mr. Roootenberg for damages in the amount of $595,000.
[10]          
The action against B-G Enterprises Inc. operating as B-G Enterprise Real
Estate Group Inc., Bonnie Gottlieb and Myron Gottlieb (the “Other Defendants”)
is dismissed without costs.
[11]          
This is a case of romance fraud.  Ms. Smith met Mr. Rootenberg through
the eHarmony dating website in July 2013 and began dating. At that time she
knew him as Mr. Rothberg.
[12]          
Mr. Rootenberg convinced Ms. Smith to invest in two purported investment
opportunities.  She invested $160,000 on September 17, 2013 for an alleged
investment in Social Trivia and $435,000 on October 22, 2013 to invest in
second mortgages on her behalf.  She gave him her life savings of $595,000.
[13]          
Mr. Rootenberg made some “interest payments” to Ms. Smith totaling $36,544.
[14]          
Mr. Rootenberg directed the Defendant Myron Gottlieb (“Mr. Gottlieb) to
disburse Ms. Smith’s funds between September 18, 2013 and April 2014 to Mr.
Rootenberg, Mr. Gottlieb, Mr. Rootenberg’s sister, to a BMW car dealership and to
other associates of Mr. Rootenberg.
[15]          
In November 2014 Ms. Smith discovered that “Mr. Rothberg’s” real name is
Mr. Rootenberg and that he has a criminal record for fraud.  The relationship
between them ended shortly afterwards.
[16]          
Ms. Smith did not receive any “interest payments” after September 2015.
[17]          
On July 19, 2019 Mr. Rootenberg was convicted of fraud over $5,000
contrary to s.380(1) of the Criminal Code R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 (the “Code”)
in relation to the money Ms. Smith gave to him: R. v. Rootenberg, 2019
ONSC 4145.
[18]          
On September 30, 2020 Mr. Rootenberg was sentenced to six years in
prison and ordered to make restitution to Ms. Smith in the amount of $558,456
to be paid no more than 5 years following his release from prison: R. v.
Rootenberg, 2020 ONSC 5928 at paras. 124-125 (the “Restitution Order”).
[19]          
There are 4 issues as follows:
[20]          
Rule 48.04 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194
provides that a party who sets an action down for trial may not initiate a
motion without leave of the court.
[21]          
The test under r. 48.04 is the subject of some disagreement. Some courts
have required a change in circumstances, others have determined that leave should
be granted if the motion is necessary in the interests of justice, and some
courts have considered both a change in circumstances and the interests of
justice: Horani v. Manulife Financial Corporation, 2023 ONCA 51,
at paras. 16-19.
[22]          
Leave may be granted for a summary judgment motion which, if successful will
bring an end to the action and be faster and cheaper than a trial: Rego v
Walmart, 2017 ONSC 812 at para. 13-15 citing Fruitland Juices Inc. v.
Custom Farm Service Inc., 2012 ONSC 4902, [2012] O.J. No. 4050.
[23]          
In this case, the interests of justice require that leave be granted
because there is no doubt that the summary judgment motion will provide a
faster and cheaper resolution than a trial.
[24]          
Rule 20.04(2)(a) is mandatory and provides: “The court shall grant
summary judgment if the court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue
requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence”.
[25]          
There is no genuine issue requiring a trial when the court is able to
reach a fair and just determination on the merits of the motion. This will be
the case where the process (1) allows the court to make necessary findings of
fact, (2) allows the court to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a
proportionate, more expeditious, and less expensive means to achieve a just
result: Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87 at
para. 49; Moffitt v. TD Canada Trust, 2023 ONCA 349, 483 D.L.R. (4th)
432, at para. 39.
[26]          
The court is entitled to assume that it has all the evidence that would
be available at trial related to the matters at issue: Portuguese Canadian
Credit Union v. Pires, 2011 ONSC 7448, at para. 11, aff’d 2012 ONCA 335.
[27]          
In Bank of Montreal v. Woldegabriel, the court found that there
was no genuine issue for trial in a claim for damages for fraud in a case where
the plaintiff primarily relied on the defendant's criminal convictions of fraud
arising out of the same transactions at issue in the civil proceeding: at para.
73, aff’d 2008 ONCA 71, leave to appeal dismissed with costs 2008 CanLII 32724
(SCC).
[28]          
I am satisfied that I can make the necessary findings of fact, apply the
law to the facts and come to a just result.
[29]          
Section 22.1 of the Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23 provides
as follows:
[30]          
 In this case, Mr. Rootenberg was convicted, appealed and lost in the
Court of Appeal.
[31]          
The Criminal Code s. 691 (1)(b) provides that Mr. Rootenberg must
seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (the “SCC”). He has not
applied for leave to appeal to the SCC.
[32]          
Under the Supreme Court Act R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 s. 58(1)(a) the
time limit to apply for leave to appeal is 60 days from the date of the judgment
of  the Court of Appeal decision on June 18, 2024. The month of July is
excluded from the calculation. The time for Mr. Rootenberg to apply for leave
to appeal expired on September 16, 2024.
[33]          
Mr. Rootenberg said that he has spoken to his criminal lawyer about the
possibility of applying for an extension of  time to apply for leave to appeal and
therefore s.22.1 does not apply.
[34]          
I give no effect to this submission.  If Mr. Rootenberg is correct then
section 22.1 would be meaningless because a further appeal is always a
possibility.
[35]          
Section 22.1 is a rule of evidence intended to expedite the proving of
facts decided in a criminal case in a subsequent proceeding. In a civil case,
proof of the defendant’s prior conviction is proof of the verdict and the
essential facts of the offence: Lambert v. Lambert, 2022 ONSC 6432, at
para. 9.
[36]          
Evidence of the fact of a prior conviction is proof of the fact that the
convicted person committed the crime absent “evidence to the contrary.” It is
proof of all the facts essential to that conviction absent "evidence to
the contrary". “Evidence to the contrary” refers to evidence that
contradicts the facts essential to the conviction: Intact Insurance Company
v. Federated Insurance Company of Canada, 2017 ONCA 73, 134 O.R. (3d) 241,
at paras. 17-19.
[37]          
While generally, Mr. Rootenberg may lead “evidence to the contrary” to
avoid the evidentiary rule in s. 22.1, in this case, the common law doctrine of
abuse of process may prevent him from doing so: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E.,
Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at paras. 18-19; Intact
Insurance, at paras. 20-22.
[38]          
The abuse of process doctrine is a broad, flexible common law doctrine
developed by the courts to protect the integrity of the adjudicative process.
“It serves as an adaptable judicial tool to address circumstances that threaten
the fairness and integrity of the court’s process and the administration of
justice.”: La Française IC 2 v. Wires 2024 ONCA 171 at para 8. The
doctrine precludes re-litigation of decided facts when doing so would undermine
the integrity of the adjudicative process.
[39]          
In Intact Insurance, at para. 28, the court summarized the
following principles from the reasons of Arbour J. in C.U.P.E.:
[40]          
The question is, in the circumstances of this case, whether allowing Mr.
Rootenberg relitigate the facts underlying his conviction is fair and whether
it will enhance the integrity, credibility and effectiveness of the
administration of justice to allow him to do so.
[41]          
Circumstances in which it may be fair to allow re-litigation include
situations where the original case was tainted by fraud
or dishonesty, the stakes were too minor to generate a full and robust
response, fresh new evidence previously unavailable conclusively impeaches the
original results or there was an inadequate incentive to defend: C.U.P.E.,
at paras. 52-53. Other such circumstances include a lack of fairness or
effective representation in the original case or different issues: Hanna v.
Abbott (2006), 2006 CanLII 27865 (ON CA), 82 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.), at para. 32; Canam Enterprises Inc.
v. Coles (2000), 2000 CanLII 8514 (ON CA), 51 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 57.
[42]          
Mr. Rootenberg did not suggest his criminal trial was unfair, or was tainted
by fraud or dishonesty, or that the stakes were too minor.  He does not submit
there is fresh new evidence previously unavailable.  He does not say he did not
have effective representation.
[43]          
The doctrine of abuse of process bars Mr. Rootenberg  from re-litigating
the essential facts of the offence. He cannot adduce evidence contrary to the
essential facts of the conviction or evidence to displace the conviction: Lambert
at para. 10.  It would be an abuse of process to allow re-litigation.
[44]          
The factual findings in the criminal decisions establish the three
certainties necessary for breach of trust.  The criminal courts in this case
found that Ms. Smith and Mr. Rootenberg made an agreement pursuant to which Ms.
Smith transferred to Mr. Rootenberg $160,000 to invest in Social Trivia and
$435,000 to invest in second mortgages. She gave him the funds to invest on her
behalf and for her benefit to earn returns. I find that this was a verbal
express trust: Dhillon v Dasta, 2024 BCSC 360 at para. 56.
[45]          
If I am wrong that there was an express trust, I find this was a
resulting trust because Mr. Rootenberg received Ms. Smith’s funds for no value
and therefore, he is under an obligation to return them to her: Pecore v.
Pecore, 2007 SCC 17 at para. 20.
[46]          
Mr. Rootenberg breached the trust by diverting the funds for his
personal use and the use of third parties as found by the trial judge in the
criminal case: Rootenberg (trial decision) at paras. 138 and 321 and Rootenberg
(appeal decision) at para. 6.
[47]          
Mr. Rootenberg submitted that it is not necessary for me to grant
summary judgment in favour of Ms. Smith because there is already a Restitution Order
from the criminal proceedings.
[48]          
I reject this submission because the Criminal Code provides that
a civil remedy is not affected by reason only that an order for restitution has
been made: s. 741.2.
[49]          
There is good reason to grant summary judgement because the Restitution Order
is only enforceable five years after Mr. Rootenberg’s release from prison which
is sometime in February 2027 and the Restitution Order does not provide for
interest.
[50]          
There is no risk of double recovery. Accounting for the “interest
payments” Mr. Rootenberg made, the balancing owing to Ms. Smith is $558,456. 
The judgment will provide that Ms. Smith’s entitlement is reduced by any amount
recovered under the Restitution Order.
[51]          
The Plaintiff and the Other Defendants consent to an order dismissing
this action against the Other Defendants because they have settled the case as
between them.
[52]          
Mr. Rootenberg does not consent.
[53]          
Mr. Rootenberg filed his Statement of Defence on August 14, 2017 and has
never advanced a cross claim against the other Defendants.
[54]          
The claim as against the Other Defendants is dismissed because the
affected parties are consenting.  There is no prejudice to Mr. Rootenberg as he
did not cross claim against the Other Defendants and there is no Pierrenger
agreement.
[55]          
The Plaintiff seeks costs on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of
$100,000. Unfortunately the Bill of Costs provided does not describe any of the
work done up until the motion for summary judgment but merely lists the names
and experience of the timekeepers, dates (in groups of several months), hours
and amounts.  The total partial indemnity costs on the Bill of Costs is
$150,839.70. For the summary judgment motion the Plaintiff seeks partial
indemnity costs of just under $45,000. There were no cross examinations and
only the four-page affidavit of a legal assistant in the Plaintiff’s motion
record.  The Defendant did not file any responding material.
[56]          
I have considered the factors under r. 57.01(1) including the time
spent, rates charged, reasonable expectations of the parties, as well as the
amount claimed by the Plaintiff in the statement of claim. In my view, having
regard to all of the factors, I find that $50,000 inclusive of HST and
disbursements is appropriate.
[57]          
Ms. Smith is granted leave to bring this motion and granted judgment in
the amount of $558,456 plus prejudgment interest pursuant to the Court of
Justice Act s. 128 calculated from October 22, 2013 in the amount of
$49,682.69 and costs in the amount of $50,000 inclusive of HST and
disbursements.
