[1]              
On October 23, 2024, this Court granted a Mareva
injunction as against the Defendants which I varied on October 30, 2024, and
November 13, 2024.
[2]              
On November 15, 2024, I heard and dismissed,
with reasons to follow, the Defendants’ motion to remove Plaintiff’s counsel as
solicitor of record for the Plaintiff. My reasons for dismissing the motion are
set out below.
[3]              
The Defendants, Jie Chen (“Chen”) and Feiyan Gao
(“Gao”), move to lift the Mareva injunction as against them. By Endorsement
dated November 18, 2024, I ordered that for reasons which were to follow, the
Order of Justice de Sa made October 30, 2024, varied by my Orders of October
30, 2024 and November 13, 2024, shall continue in force until further order of
this Court. This decision sets out my reasons for denying Chen and Gao’s
motion.
[4]              
The Defendants Bai, Chen, Gao and Easyline seek
to discharge the certificate of pending litigation (CPL) which I grant. My
reasons for discharging the CPL are set out below.
[5]              
This issues on this motion are:
[6]              
I will briefly outline the facts in this case
before addressing the issues.
[7]              
This is a brief overview of the relationship
between the parties. I will set out additional facts as required as they apply
to each issue.
[8]              
Tianzhu Li (“Li”) and Song Bai (“Bai”) were
friends. Li gave money to Bai to invest on her behalf through mortgages.
[9]              
Easyline Mortgage Inc. (“Easyline”), is a
corporation organized under the laws of Ontario with its head office at Bai’s
home in Toronto, the property that is the subject of the CPL.
[10]          
CYD Investment Inc. and CY Capital Inc. are Ontario
corporations with head offices in York Region which Bai used to advance
mortgages.
[11]          
Bai and Gao are married. Chen is Bai’s mother.
Bai and Chen jointly own a property for which leave to issue a CPL was granted.
Bai is 1% owner and Chen 99%.
[12]          
Chen lives part-time in Canada and part-time in
China. While in China, she permitted her bank account to be used by Bai who
used the account for his own personal use and for business.
[13]          
I will address the facts, the governing
principles, and then apply the facts to the principles.
[14]          
The Defendants alleges that the Plaintiff’s
solicitor is in a direct conflict of interest. As detailed in the affidavit of
Song Bai, Bai commenced a different action against Jian Liu and Metasigns Inc.
The Plaintiff’s solicitors represent Jian Liu and Metasigns Inc. in the
separate action.
[15]          
Mr. Bai alleges that he connected with Liu and
Metasigns Inc. in respect of currency conversion services when he needed to
convert funds in Renminbi (RMB) to Canadian dollars (CAD). Bai alleges that Liu,
operating through Metasigns, told Bai that Metasigns could bypass strict
foreign exchange controls imposed by China to convert and transfer RMB from
China to CAD in Canada.
[16]          
Bai completed several successful transactions with
Metasigns and Liu and received a commission for so doing.
[17]          
Bai alleges at paragraph 5 of his claim that:
[18]          
Bai alleges that after some time, he remitted
money received from clients to Metasigns but he did not receive funds in return.
He states that he gave money he received from Li and other funds to pay his
money conversion clients when he did not receive payment from Liu. Bai states
that he did so because Liu misrepresented to him that he had the money to pay,
but that he was waiting for a bank hold to be lifted. Bai states that Liu and
Metasigns owe him $1,311,634.61 and that Liu has now left Canada for China
without paying him.
[19]          
Bai then commenced an action against Liu and
Metasigns. They have defended the action denying the allegations. The
Plaintiff’s solicitor acts for Liu and Metasigns.
[20]          
Bai alleges that he used some of Li’s money to
pay Liu. He asserts that, as a result, Li’s interests are now directly adverse
to the interests of Metasigns and Liu and that the Plaintiff’s solicitor’s
interests are in conflict. He further asserts that he may bring a third-party
claim in this action against Liu. He has not provided documentation of the
transaction to support his allegation that Li’s money was given to Liu.
[21]          
In response, the Plaintiff asserts that there is
no conflict, that she has been fully informed of the other claim, and that she
and Mr. Liu are working together as at this point their interests align.
[22]          
The Plaintiff has tendered evidence that a
potential conflict was discussed with both clients.
[23]          
In Canadian National Railway Co. v. McKercher
LLP, the Supreme Court of Canada set out that the lawyer’s duty of loyalty
has three key components: a duty to avoid conflicting interests, a duty of
commitment to the client’s cause, and a duty of candour.
[24]          
There is a bright line rule that a law firm
cannot act for a client whose interests are adverse to those of another
existing client unless both clients consent. This rule relates to the immediate
interests of the client that are directly adverse in a legal interest, which is
to be distinguished from a strategic or commercial interest. It does not apply
to unrelated matters. See McKercher, supra, at paras. 33-37.
[25]          
One of the dangers is a concern that
confidential information of one party could be abused.
[26]          
Other relevant principles are set out in Tiffin
v. Teplitsky Colson LLP, 2018 ONSC 5122, at paras. 29-32:
[27]          
I find that the actions are not related and that
the bright line rule does not apply. At present, Li and Liu are united against
Bai. There is no evidence to support Bai’s assertion that he used Li’s money to
pay Liu.
[28]          
The facts here do not meet the “clearest of
cases” standard. I am of the view that a fair-minded reasonably
informed member of the public would not conclude that the proper administration
of justice requires removal.
[29]          
I agree that things could change, however, at present
Li and Liu do not have directly adverse legal interests. A hypothetical action
(the suggestion of a third-party claim) is not reason to remove the Plaintiff’s
choice of counsel now.
[30]          
I decline to grant the relief sought.
[31]          
Chen and Gao argue that the injunction should be
lifted as against them. They assert that the Plaintiff has failed to establish
a strong prima facie case against them and that the injunction has
caused significant hardship against them and prevented them from meeting family
obligations including mortgage payments, family expenses and the operation of
the Gao’s businesses. Gao is a piano teacher and co-owns a pet store.
[32]          
I have not been persuaded that the injunction
should be lifted. Money has been moved between the accounts of Bai and Chen and
Bai and Gao and their joint accounts and it appears that Chen and Gao may have
been the recipients of funds misappropriated by Bai.
[33]          
The Defendants’ accounts have been co-mingled and
it appears that Bai gave money to Gao, that they have a joint account and that
there have been transfers between all three accounts. Bai and Chen’s funds are
also co-mingled.
[34]          
While both Chen and Gao have deposed that they
did not have knowledge of Bai’s financial dealings, I find that the transfers
to and from their accounts implicate them.
[35]          
I am prepared to consider the lifting of the
injunction as against the pet store. However, this was not the focus of the parties’
submissions. If the parties can reach a consent on a term relating to the
operation of the pet store, I will consider it by way of further written
submissions limited to no more than two double-spaced pages to be delivered by
November 26, 2024.
[36]          
Li has not demonstrated an interest in the
property. The property was purchased by Chen and Bai in 2011. This is prior to when
Li began investing with Bai.
[37]          
The Plaintiff’s original motion record filed in
support of the CPL asserted that the property arrangement was a deliberate
attempt to shield the property from creditors. In my view, the evidence that
Bai and Chen purchased the property under this arrangement 13 years ago,
undermines this argument.
[38]          
Looking at the factors set out in 931473
Ontario Ltd. v. Dhunna, [1987] OJ No 1073, I find that the Plaintiff
has no interest in the land, that the land is not unique.
[39]          
In my view, the Plaintiff sought the CPL to
ensure that the Defendants Bai and Chen could not make themselves judgment proof.
However, without an interest in the land, the CPL should be discharged and I so
order.
[40]          
I grant leave for the Plaintiff to register the
CPL against the property.
[41]          
The motion to remove Ran He as the Plaintiff’s
solicitor of record is dismissed.
[42]          
The motion to lift the Mareva injunction
as against Chen and Gao is also dismissed.
[43]          
The parties shall consult to see if consent can
be reached on a term relating to the operation of the pet store. If not, any
party wishing to may file further written submissions on this issue alone,
limited to no more than two double-spaced pages to be delivered by November 26,
2024.
[44]          
The motion to discharge the CPL is granted.
[45]          
The Plaintiff shall have leave to register the Mareva
injunction as against the property against which the CPL was granted.
[46]          
The Order of Justice de Sa dated October 13,
2024, amended by my Orders of October 30, 2024, November 13, 2024 and November
18, 2024 shall continue until further Order of the Court. For clarity, the Mareva
injunction remains in force until further court order.
[47]          
The parties shall attempt to agree on the terms
of a draft order for my consideration.
[48]          
The parties are urged to resolve costs. If they
cannot, I may be spoken to.
