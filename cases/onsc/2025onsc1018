[1]              
On this motion, the Defendant, Registered
Nurses’ Association of Ontario (“RNAO”) seeks to: a) strike the statement of
claim under Rule 21.01(1)(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for
disclosing no reasonable cause of action, and/or b) stay or dismiss the action
as an abuse of process pursuant to Rule 21.01(3)(c) as another proceeding (CV-24-4121)
is pending between the parties in respect of the same subject matter.  The
Plaintiff, Melissa Dore, who is self-represented, submits that her claim in
this action against RNAO for not acting in good faith is viable and should be
allowed to proceed.
[2]              
For the reasons that follow, the motion is
dismissed.
[3]              
The Plaintiff, Ms. Dore, is a nurse and a member
of RNAO.
[4]              
RNAO is a professional association of nurses and
nursing students in Ontario.  One feature of RNAO membership is the Legal
Assistance Program (“LAP”).  LAP offers RNAO members discretionary funding for
legal services to address certain matters that include a member’s nursing
practice and licence with the College of Nurses of Ontario (“College”), among
others.[1]
[5]              
 In January 2022, Ms. Dore requested LAP legal
services to defend allegations before the College that she had engaged in
professional misconduct.  LAP arranged for counsel on a limited retainer to act
for Ms. Dore in dealing with initial correspondence with the College to clarify
what information it sought for its investigation into her conduct. LAP counsel advised
Ms. Dore that the limited retainer did not extend to cover the balance of the College’s
investigation. On January 28, 2022, LAP counsel advised Ms. Dore that a request
had been submitted to RNAO for additional LAP funding to extend the scope of the
retainer.  LAP counsel advised her on February 10, 2022 that she had removed
herself from the case, and advised the College on February 22, 2022 that she no
longer acted for Ms. Dore.
[6]              
RNAO advised Ms. Dore that LAP funding is
approved in stages and that further requests for legal services under the
program beyond the scope of the initial retainer would be considered by its LAP
Committee in its discretion.
[7]              
Subsequently, Ms. Dore applied to RNAO for further
LAP legal services. RNAO denied her request and advised on December 4, 2023
that the chair of the LAP Committee was preparing a letter detailing the
reasons for denial that could be appealed to the Board Executive Committee.  Later
that day, Ms. Dore advised RNAO of her intention to appeal the denial.  RNAO
confirmed on December 6, 2023 that the chair of the LAP Committee was preparing
reasons for the denial and invited Ms. Dore to submit a statement outlining the
reasons for the appeal and the relief being sought.  In response, Ms. Dore advised
that she could not cite reasons for the appeal without first having the reasons
for denial.  When Ms. Dore asked RNAO on January 12, 2024 when the reasons for
denial would be released, RNAO advised that, “[y]our case has been referred
to the executive committee, and we will be in touch around mid-March.”
[8]              
Importantly, Ms. Dore desperately wanted LAP
legal services to defend a conduct hearing before the College that was scheduled
to start on January 8, 2024.  Starting on October 23, 2023, she repeatedly asked
RNAO for the LAP Committee’s reasons for denial so that she could prepare an
appeal to the Board Executive Committee.  But despite the time-sensitive nature
of her request for LAP assistance, RNAO advised that she would not be contacted
by the LAP Committee or the Board Executive Committee until mid-March 2024 (i.e.,
well after the College conduct hearing was scheduled to begin).
[9]              
By March 2, 2024, neither the LAP Committee nor
the Board Executive Committee had responded to Ms. Dore with the reasons for denying
her application for LAP legal services.
[10]          
On March 20, 2024, Ms. Dore commenced the within
action (CV-24-1402).  The statement of claim pleads that RNAO was required to
act promptly and fairly in deciding applications for LAP assistance from its
members. The claim also claims that RNAO breached its obligation to act fairly and
in good faith in reviewing and processing Ms. Dore’s application for LAP legal
services by not providing a timely explanation for denying her application. 
The claim further pleads that RNAO’s failure to provide her with a timely
explanation resulted in a marked departure from ordinary standards of decency
and a failure to discharge its duty to act fairly and in good faith.
[11]          
In this statement of claim, Ms. Dore seeks
$410,000.00 in damages due to RNAO’s alleged failure to act in good faith by
not providing her with its reasons for denying her LAP application in timely
fashion.  This claim also pleads that RNAO’s conduct caused Ms. Dore to suffer
extreme mental and emotional distress.
[12]          
On September 2, 2024, Ms. Dore commenced a
second action (CV-24-4121) arising from the same allegations raised in the
first action (CV-24-1402).  The second action seeks $4.41 million in damages and
names the following as defendants: the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario
(RNAO) Legal Assistance Program (LAP), the RNAO Board of Directors, and three
personally-named RNAO officials who are alleged to have dealt with Ms. Dore’s LAP
application.  Like the first action, the second action refers to RNAO’s denial
of Ms. Dore’s application for further LAP legal services (i.e., beyond the limited
retainer that RNAO had approved for the initial exchange of correspondence with
the College in 2022) and claims that the various defendants named in the second
action had breached their obligation to act in good faith by neglecting to
communicate the reasons for denying further LAP assistance.  Among other things,
the second action claims that the named defendants committed an intentional abuse
or misfeasance of public office that is framed as a separate and independent
wrong unrelated to RNAO’s decision to deny Ms. Dore’s application for further LAP
legal services.
[13]          
Rule 2.02(b) provides that a motion to attack an
irregularity shall not be brought, except with leave of the court, if the
moving party has taken any further step in the proceeding after obtaining
knowledge of the irregularity.[2]
[14]          
The statement of claim was issued on March 20, 2024. 
RNAO served its statement of defence on May 6, 2024.[3]  In the statement of defence,
RNAO pleads that the statement of claim in the within proceeding (CV-24-1402) should
be dismissed for not establishing a cause of action.[4]  Subsequently, on
November 22, 2024, RNAO brought this motion to strike or stay the action for
not disclosing a reasonable cause of action and being duplicative with Ms.
Dore’s second statement of claim (CV-24-4121) issued on September 2, 2024.
[15]          
Generally, a defendant should move to strike a
claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action before filing a statement of
defence.  However, the defendant may bring such a motion without leave even
after delivering a defence when it is obvious from its pleading that it opposes
the sufficiency of the claim: Potis Holdings Ltd.
v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2019
ONCA 618 at para 14; Arsenijevich v. Ontario (Provincial Police), 2019
ONCA 150 at para 7.
[16]          
It is clear and obvious from its statement of defence
that RNAO took issue with the sufficiency of the statement of claim in this
action.  Only after RNAO delivered its defence did Ms. Dore commence the second
action.  In the circumstances, I find that RNAO’s motion to strike or stay the
statement of claim in this first action may be heard without leave: Potis at
para 14.  In any event, I would find that RNAO brought this motion with
reasonable diligence such that trial efficiency would not be impacted as the action
is at the pleadings stage. Accordingly, I am satisfied that it is appropriate
for the court to hear and decide RNAO’s motion under Rule 21.01.
[17]          
As discussed below, I find that it would be
premature to strike Ms. Dore’s claim in the within action in respect of RNAO’s
alleged breach of duty to act in good faith.
[18]          
Rule 21.01(1)(b) provides that a party may move
to strike out a pleading where it discloses no reasonable cause of action or
defence.  Pursuant to Rule 21.01(2), no evidence is admissible on a Rule
21.01(1)(b) motion.
[19]          
The court will strike a claim under Rule
21.01(1)(b) only when it is plain and obvious, assuming the pleaded facts to be
true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or has no reasonable
prospect of success: R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 at
paras 17 and 22; Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69 at paras 14-15; Hunt v. Carey Canada
Inc., 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990] 2 SCR 959 at 980; PMC
York Properties Inc. v. Siudak, 2022
ONCA 635 at para 31, leave to appeal denied 2023 CanLII 3156 (SCC).  The facts as
pleaded are assumed to be true unless they are manifestly incapable of being
proven: Imperial Tobacco at para 22; Atlantic Lottery Corp. Inc. v.
Babstock, 2020 SCC 19 at para 87. It is beyond well-established that the
bar for striking a pleading is high: Ibid; PMC at para 30.  Where a
reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed
to trial: Imperial Tobacco at para 17.
[20]          
On a Rule 21.01(1)(b)
motion, the statement of claim should be read as generously as possible to accommodate
any inadequacies in the form of the allegations that are merely the result of drafting
deficiencies as cases should, if possible, be disposed of on their merits: Atlantic
Lottery at para 88; PMC York at para 31.  This
generous approach under Rule 21.01(1)(b) must err on the side of permitting a
novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial: Imperial Tobacco at para
21.  The court is to consider whether the pleadings, as they stand or may
reasonably be amended, disclose a claim that is not doomed to fail: Atlantic
Lottery at para 90; PMC York at para 32.
[21]          
A statement of claim will
be deficient under Rule 21.01(1)(b) where it fails to plead the material facts
required to sustain a particular cause of action: Abbasbayli v. Fiera Foods
Company, 2021 ONCA 95 at para 20; Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co., 2015 ONCA 305 at para 21, leave to appeal
denied 2016 CanLII 940 (SCC).
[22]          
Pepall J.A. writing for the Court of Appeal in McCreight v. Canada (Attorney–General), 2013 ONCA 483 at para 39, set out the applicable principles
on a Rule 21.01(1)(b) motion as follows:
[23]          
The test under Rule
21.01(1)(b) is stringent, and the moving party must satisfy a very high
threshold to succeed: Fernandez
Leon v. Bayer Inc., 2023 ONCA
629 at para 8; PMC at para 30.  The rationale for this high
standard is based on, “the liberal construction of rules and pleadings that
underlies the Rules of Civil Procedure and the requisite generous approach to
pleadings in general, in order, as rule 1.04(1) provides, to secure ‘the just,
most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on
its merits’: PMC York at paras 33-34.
[24]          
On reading the within statement of claim in the
broadest and least-critical manner, with generous allowances for drafting
deficiencies, it is apparent that the claim is based on an alleged breach by RNAO
of its obligation to act in good faith by neglecting to give timely reasons for
denying Ms. Dore’s application for LAP legal services.  Ms. Dore was eligible for
LAP assistance by virtue of her membership with RNAO that decided applications from
its members for LAP legal services in its discretion.  Ms. Dore claims that
RNAO was under a duty to reasonably exercise its discretion in good faith without
capriciousness or arbitrariness.  Contract law jurisprudence would arguably
support a duty to act in good faith in this context: Bhasin v. Hrynew,
2014 SCC 71 at para 63; 2161907 Alberta Ltd. v.
11180673 Canada Inc., 2021 ONCA 590
at para 44; Jones v. Quinn, 2024 ONCA 315 at para 74.  Ms. Dore’s claim
does not expressly plead a contract, but clearly refers to the LAP as a
discretionary program that RNAO offers to its members as a feature of
membership in the association. In light of this membership context, I am
prepared to accept that the circumstances in which RNAO offers LAP legal
services to its members arguably implicates a contractual relationship that may
ground a duty of good faith: Dumbrell v. Regional Group of Companies Inc., 2007
ONCA 59 at para 54. Even if RNAO offers LAP
assistance on a purely discretionary basis, an obligation for RNAO to exercise its
discretionary approval in good faith may arguably apply when a member is facing
a regulatory investigation or conduct hearing into misconduct allegations with
potentially significant consequences where LAP legal services would help the
member to defend the allegations: Al-Ghamdi
v College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta, 2017 ABQB 685 at para 195, affirmed 2020 ABCA 81,
leave to appeal denied 2021 CanLII 13262 (SCC).  Jurisprudence has not yet
recognized this cause of action, but a novel and arguable claim should be
permitted to proceed to trial: Imperial Tobacco at para 21; McCreight
at para 39.
[25]          
I am not persuaded by RNAO’s submission that the
statement of claim discloses no cause of action.  In my view, the law on the applicability
of a good faith duty on a professional association approving a discretionary service
or benefit for a member remains unsettled. Neither party cited any jurisprudence
on this point.  A claim is not struck merely for being novel: McCreight
at para 39.  In any event, where employment or livelihood is at stake, an
objective intention to establish a contractual relationship is more likely to
exist:  Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church of
Canada St. Mary Cathedral v. Aga, 2021
SCC 22 at paras 38 and 40.  A misconduct investigation or conduct hearing may have
significant professional consequences for a subject member’s practice. Accordingly,
it would seem at least arguable that RNAO may be obliged to determine a
member’s LAP application for legal services to defend professional misconduct
allegations by exercising its discretionary approval in good faith: Foran v.
Kottmeier, 1973 CanLII 726 (ON CA), [1973] 3 OR 1002 (CA). RNAO may act in its own best interests, but
may also be obliged to have proper regard for a member’s legitimate contractual
interests and not undermine them in bad faith: Bhasin at para 65; Royal
Bank of Canada v. Peace Bridge Duty Free Inc., 2025 ONCA 54 at para 59.
[26]          
In light of the foregoing, I do not find it
plain or obvious that Ms. Dore’s good faith claim cannot succeed or is doomed
to failure given the unsettled jurisprudence on the nature and scope of RNAO’s
duty in deciding her LAP application: McCreight at para 39.  Even if
RNAO ultimately approved LAP legal services for her, as pleaded in the statement
of defence that it has delivered, the jurisprudence on the implications of any delay
in making its decision to approve her LAP application remains unsettled. When the
applicable law is not fully settled in the jurisprudence, the court should not
dispose of a claim on a motion to strike: Kang v.
Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 2013 ONCA 118 at para 33; Addison Chevrolet Buick GMC Limited v. General Motors of
Canada Limited, 2016 ONCA 324 at para
53, leave to appeal denied 2017 CanLII 4177 (SCC).
[27]          
Accordingly, I decline to strike the statement
of claim under Rule 21.01(1)(b).
[28]          
I do not find that the within statement of claim
(CV-24-1402) should be stayed or dismissed to avoid an unjust multiplicity of
proceedings due to the second statement of claim (CV-24-4121).
[29]          
Rule 21.01(3)(c) allows
a defendant to move to have an action stayed or dismissed on the basis that
another proceeding is pending in Ontario or another jurisdiction between the
parties in respect of the same subject matter.  This rule invokes the doctrine
of abuse of process that is applied to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings or
the re-litigation of an issue, such as when another proceeding against some or
all of the same parties replicates the same or similar issues: Cashin Mortgages Inc. (Verico Cashin
Mortgages) v. 2511311 Ontario Ltd. (Mortgages Alliance – Main Street Mortgages), 2024 ONCA 103 at para 17.  The abuse of
process doctrine ensures that no
one should be “twice vexed by the same cause,” to “uphold the
integrity of the legal system in order to avoid inconsistent results, and to
protect the principle of finality so crucial to the proper administration of
justice”: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC
63 at para 38.  The doctrine engages the court’s inherent power to prevent a misuse
of its procedure that is manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation or that
would in some other way bring the administration of justice into
disrepute: Behn Moulton Contracting Ltd., 2013 SCC 26 at
paras 39-40; Cashin at para 17.
[30]          
The Court of Appeal in Birdseye
Security Inc. v. Milosevic, 2020 ONCA 355 at paras 15-16 set out the principles
for the court to exercise in deciding whether an action should be stayed or dismissed
under Rule 21.01(3)(c) as an abuse of process:
[31]          
The abuse of process
doctrine is broader than res judicata and issue estoppel and
applies to bar litigation that would violate such principles as judicial
economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of
justice: Winter v. Sherman Estate, 2018 ONCA 703 at para 7, leave
to appeal dismissed [2020] CanLII 22065 (SCC); Toronto
(City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 at para 37. A stay is
granted only in the clearest of cases where a continuance would cause an
injustice: Tewari v. Hantover
Canada Inc., 2024 ONSC 5453
at paras 16-18.
[32]          
I accept that the
pleadings in the second statement of claim are somewhat duplicative of those in
the first action.  However, the existence of almost identical pleadings in both
actions is not necessarily sufficient to constitute an abuse of process: Birdseye
at para 18.  Moreover, the second statement of claim clearly seeks further
relief against differently-named defendants based on their alleged involvement
in deciding Ms. Dore’s application for LAP legal services.
[33]          
I agree with RNAO that the relief sought by Ms.
Dore in the second action could and perhaps should have been brought in the
first action.  Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the proper remedy in the
context of this litigation is to stay or dismiss all or part of the first statement
of claim. In my view, the duplicative nature of the first action with the
second action may be remedied in a less intrusive fashion.
[34]          
As discussed in submissions, there would clearly
be advantages in having the first action tried together with, or immediately
after, the second action.  However, as a Rule 6.01 motion was not brought, I
decline to grant such an order without a formal motion on notice so that Ms.
Dore, who is self-represented, is not deprived of the opportunity to fully
consider her position and prepare fulsome submissions on the matter.  To this
end, I recognize that there may well be valid reasons for not ordering a
consolidation or hearing together of the actions, such as the potential for delay
in proceeding to trial: Heldmann v. Parlee, 2021 ONSC 4904 at para 37.  But if the second
action against the various defendants is tried together with, or immediately
after, the first action against RNAO, then Ms. Dore may well be able to
litigate all of her claims against RNAO and the other named-defendants and fully
address the circumstances giving rise to her claims in both actions without any
risk of inconsistent findings.  In addition, if an order to have the actions
tried together is obtained quickly, there would be no real additional costs to
the parties, respectively.
[35]          
Irrespective of the fact that she is claiming
over $4 million in damages in the second action, I accept that Ms. Dore is
attempting to assert genuine claims against RNAO and other defendants with respect
to her application for LAP legal services and the alleged delay in obtaining reasons
for decision on the application.  The facts pleaded in the first action are
assumed to be true on this pleadings motion, and I accept that those facts support
the claims being raised in the within action that arguably have some merit.  In
addition, I do not find that Ms. Dore’s second action in itself gives rise to
any injustice or prejudice to RNAO, particularly as further relief is being sought
against other named defendants in that proceeding. In the circumstances, I
decline to find that she acted vexatiously in bringing the second action.
[36]          
I would encourage both sides to collaborate on a
process that will achieve the objectives under Rule 1.04(1) to achieve, “the
most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on
its merits.” To this end, I would strongly encourage the parties to
consider consenting to have the actions tried together, or one immediately
after the other, or otherwise moving under Rule 6.01 for this relief.
[37]          
For these reasons, I decline the motion to stay
or dismiss the within statement of claim under Rule 21.01(3)(c).
[38]          
Based on the foregoing, the motion is dismissed.
[39]          
If the parties are unable resolve the issue of
costs for this motion, Ms. Dore may deliver written costs submissions of up to
2 pages (excluding her costs outline or any offer(s) to settle) within 15 days,
and RNAO may deliver responding submissions on the same terms within a further 15
days.  Reply submissions shall not be delivered without leave.
