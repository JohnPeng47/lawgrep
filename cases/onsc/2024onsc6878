The Applicant, the Corporation of the Township
of Adjala-Tosorontio (the “Township”), brings this application for, inter
alia, an interim and permanent injunction prohibiting and restraining the
Respondents from placing waste and other debris, including wrecked, dismantled,
derelict, inoperative, discarded, unused or unlicensed vehicles, trailers,
machinery, or appliances, on the property owned by one or both of the
Respondents, as described below.
[2]               
The Respondents issued their own Notice of
Application pursuant to Court File No. 19-1146 on June 26, 2019, seeking relief
from the decision of the Property Standards committee, in which they challenged
the validity of the relevant by-laws, submitted they had legal, non-confirming
rights, and took the position that the Township’s application was statute
barred as it was brought out of time[1].
[3]              
Mr. Lindhorst and Mr. Saunders (collectively,
the “Respondents”) are associated with Part of Lot 21, Concession 2, Adjala, as
in RO169606, subject to RO16906E, in the Township of Adjala-Tosorontio, County
of Simcoe (the “Property”).  While title in the Property currently rests with
Mr. Saunders, this was by way of a transfer from Mr. Lindhorst on April 20,
2017.
[4]              
The Property consists of 2.63 acres, which is
entirely located within the regulated area of the Nottawasaga Valley
Conservation Authority (“NVCA”), due to the presence of flood plain, slope and
meander erosion hazards.
[5]              
Pursuant to the regulatory authority of the
NVCA, a permit is required prior to the placement of any structures or vehicles
within the Property in accordance with Ontario Regulation 171/06 under the Conservation
Authorities Act.  The Property does not enjoy such a permit.
[6]              
The Township has in place Property Standards
By-Law 18-56 (the “By-Law”), passed pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Building
Code Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, C. 23 (the “Act”).
[7]              
On June 7, 2018, the Township received a
compliant that the Property had many junk cars on it.  The Township’s By-Law
Endorsement Officer attended the Property, subsequently making a number of
requests to the Respondents to clean up the Property.  When these request were
not satisfied, the Township issued an Order to Comply on October 16, 2018.
[8]              
On February 22, 2019, the Township’s Property
Standards Committee confirmed the Order to Comply, extending the date for
compliance to May 1, 2019.
[9]              
The Respondents did not appeal the Order of the
Committee to the Superior Court, nor did they complete the clean-up by May 1,
2019, as required.
[10]          
This matter was first before me on January 20,
2020, and scheduled to continue March 27, 2020.  That return date was cancelled
due to the advent of COVID.  A new date was set for November 18, 2021, on the
consent of all parties.  However, that date was rescheduled at the Township’s
request.  A mediation was ordered to take place no later than January, 2022.
[11]          
The parties were back before me on January 9,
2024.  The matter was once again adjourned on terms, the most relevant being
that the Township would attend at the Property at an agreed date in May, 2024
to conduct a further site inspection.
[12]          
The purpose of the site inspection was to permit
the Township to compile a photographic record (“Record”) of the items it
maintained were in violation of the Property Standards By-Law.  Within ten days
of receiving the Record, the Respondents were to advise the Township what each
item in the Record was used for.
[13]          
The parties agreed the site visit would take
place on May 31, 2024.  On May 28, 2024, Mr. Lindhorst advised Mr. Feehley that
an ankle injury had prevented him from making changes to the Property (ie:
removing items that were in violation of the By-Law).
[14]          
Later that same day Mr. Lindhorst advised Mr.
Feehley that he would be bringing a motion to vary the Order of January 9,
2024, seeking to set a new date, and a declaration that the Township not be
permitted onto the Property until that application was heard.  Mr. Lindhorst
also advised that the Township could not access the Property unless he was
present.
[15]          
Mr. Feehley reminded Mr. Lindhorst that the
Order gave the Township the right to attend at the Property and conduct the
inspection.
[16]          
On May 29, 2024 Mr. Lindhorst confirmed that the
Township was prohibited from entering the Property until his motion was heard.
[17]          
On May 30, 2024 Mr. Feehley advised Mr.
Lindhorst that the Township would be in attendance, as agreed, on May 31, 2024.
[18]          
When the Township arrived, access to the
Property was blocked by a tractor positioned across the driveway.  Mr.
Lindhorst was not in attendance to remove the tractor.  The Township took
pictures from the roadway, which clearly demonstrate that the Property
continued to be littered with debris, contrary to the By-Law.
[19]          
In fact, when the pictures from 2024 were
compared with the pictures taken by the previous CBO for the Township in 2018
and 2019, it is apparent that the Property has remained in essentially the same
condition, with abandoned vehicles, tires, trailers, and debris littered
throughout.
[20]          
Mr. Lindhorst’s motion to vary the Order of
January 9, 2024 was dismissed by Boswell J., who held that the motion record
was an attack on the January 9, 2024 Order.
[21]          
On November 3, 2024 the Township attended at the
Property a second time.  Once again, entrance to the Property remained blocked
by the tractor.  Photographs taken on this day confirm that the site condition
remained unchanged.
[22]          
I was advised by the parties that the Township
attended the Property on November 26, 2024, during which it was noted that the
Respondents had finally taken some steps to clear the Property.
[23]          
Despite the recent show of progress, the
Township asks that it be granted an Order with teeth, one that ensures the
removal of the debris from the Property is completed.
[24]          
The Respondents’ main argument is that the
Township’s application is out of time.  I will deal with this submission first.
[25]          
According to Mr. Lindhorst, the Township first
became aware of the purported by-law infractions when it attended the Property
on June 9, 2018.  However, given that the Township did not file its Application
until July 26, 2019, it is six weeks beyond the one-year limitation period set
out in s. 36(8) of the Act.
[26]          
Section 36(8) of the Act provides that,
[27]          
Under 36(1)(c) of the Act, a person is
guilty of an offence if said person “contravenes this Act, the regulations or a
by-law passed under section 7.”
[28]          
Section 36(8) of the Act allows for
prosecution under s. 15.  However, s. 38(6) is limited to those instances where
a municipality chooses to charge a person for breaching the Act.
[29]          
Here, instead of charging the Respondents, the
Township followed the procedures set out in s. 15 of the Act, which
provides a complete code for property standards:
[30]          
The only limitation period in s. 15 of the Act
is the two-week appeal period to the Superior Court of Justice.
[31]          
The Application is not a proceeding as contemplated
by s. 36(8) of the Act.
[32]          
Therefore, the Township’s Application is not
statute-barred.
[33]          
The other arguments advanced by Mr. Lindhorst do
not hold water.  First, he suggested that part of the zoning of the Property
was agricultural, and thus he is permitted to store the tractor and other
machinery on the Property.  In fact, the Property is zoned “Open Space
Conservation”, with no provision for the storage of derelict vehicles,
trailers, machinery or appliances.  No agricultural activities are being
carried on at the Property.
[34]          
Second, Mr. Lindhorst submits that the Property
enjoys legal non-conforming status.  Again, this is incorrect.  As Mr. Feehley
explained, there was no evidence that when the By-Law was passed, the Property was
used to carry on the business of a junk yard.  In fact, Mr. Lindhorst himself
admitted that there was no business being run on the Property.
[35]          
The Respondents have reached the end of the
line.  It is high time the Property is cleaned up.
[36]          
Revised Order to go as signed by me.
[37]          
As the successful party, the Township is
presumptively entitled to its costs.  The parties are urged to try to agree on
costs.
[38]          
If the parties cannot agree, I will receive
written submissions on a 7-day turnaround, commencing with the Township,
followed by responding submissions by the Respondents, commencing 14 days from
the date of release of these reasons.  Costs submissions shall be no more
than 2 pages in length (14 pt. font size, regular 1 inch margins, 1.5 spacing),
exclusive of any costs outline or offers to settle.  All costs submissions
shall be delivered via email through my assistant at BarrieSCJJudAssistants@ontario.ca.
[39]          
If no costs submissions are received within 21
days from the date of release of these reasons, the issue of costs will be
deemed to have been settled between the parties.
