[1]             
The Defendants bring a Motion for the following
relief:
[2]                 
An uncontested trial was conducted on November
3, 2023 before Justice Miller.  On November 3, 2023 Justice Miller made the
following Order:
[3]                 
The Defendants submit that they were not properly served and as a result of
not being aware of the action they did not defend the claim.  The allegations
in the Statement of Claim are serious in that the Plaintiff alleges that the
Defendants made fraudulent misrepresentations and engaged in fraudulent and
dishonest conduct.

In Mountainview
Farms Ltd. v. McQueen 2014 ONCA 194 the Court set out the following factors
to be considered by the Court when deciding to grant a motion to set aside a
default judgement:
[5]                 
The onus is on the Plaintiff to establish that
this claim was brought to the attention of each of the Defendants.
[6]                 
The Defendants set out an informative summary
of their position as a starting point in the analysis on this issue, at para 6
of their Factum:
[7]                 
At no time did
Plaintiff’s counsel contact Coreston Law that this claim had been commenced. 
Had he done so Coreston Law could have obtained instructions from Sukhjinder
Punia about accepting service of the Statement of Claim and he could have
advised the other Defendants that this Claim had been commenced.
[8]                 
Further on this issue of service at no time did the Plaintiff’s Process Server
attempt to effect personal service before proceeding to effect service by
alternative means.
[9]                 
Rule 16.01(1) states:
[10]             
Rule 16.03 (5) states:
[11]             
The Affidavits of the
Plaintiffs Process Server clearly demonstrates that no attempts were made to
effect personal service.  Had the process server at least tried on one or more
occasions to serve the Defendants personally his actual alternative service
could be seen as a reasonable alternative to personal service.  However, there
is no evidence that any attempts were made to effect personal service.
[12]             
The Affidavit evidence filed by the Defendants calls into serious
question whether the method of service employed by the Plaintiff did in fact
bring this claim to the attention of the Defendants.
[13]             
I am not satisfied on
the evidentiary record before me on this issue that the Plaintiff has met his
onus.
[14]             
The issue of service
would end the analysis on this Motion, however, I will deal with the other
issues raised at the hearing.
[15]             
In Elekta Ltd. v.
Rodkin, 2012 ONSC 2062, M. Brown, J. (as he then was) set out the following
at para 10:
[16]             
In Casa Manila v. Iannuccilli, 2018 ONSC 7083 Sanfilippo J. stated the following at
para 11:
[17]             
In Roberts v.
Santilli, 2019 ONSC 64 (CanLII) Madam Justice Kristjanson, set out the
following at para 4:
[18]             
At no time were the
Defendants notified that they had been noted in default.
[19]             
At no time were the
Defendants served with the Uncontested Trial Material nor were they advised of
the date of the Uncontested Trial.
[20]             
All of these factors
point in the direction of granting the relief requested by the Defendants.
[21]             
Again, this should end
the analysis, however I will deal with the Plaintiff’s main position at the
Motion and that is that the Defendants do not have an arguable case and
therefore the Uncontested Order should stand.
[22]             
In Carreiro v.
Skrzeczkowska, 2021 ONSC
3614 the Court noted the following at para 9:
[23]             
The issue is whether on balance there is an “air of reality”  to the
defence not whether the defence will succeed.
[24]             
At para. 53 of their Factum the Defendants point
to the following in support of their position:
[25]             
In reviewing the
proposed Statement of Defence, I am satisfied that the Defendants have
established an “air of reality” to their defence.
[26]             
The prejudice to the Defendants is such that if the Motion is not
granted the case will not be heard on its merits.  The allegations of fraud are
serious and this case warrants a trial on its merits.
[27]             
The prejudice to the Plaintiff is minimal in that the Plaintiff can
still proceed with the claim on its merits.  The prejudice to the Defendants
far outweighs any prejudice to the Plaintiff.
[28]             
I agree with the Defendants position as
articulated at para 63 of their Factum:
[29]             
In this case the following factors support the granting of the Motion as it
relates to the integrity of the Administration of Justice:
[30]             
The integrity in the Administration of Justice in
these circumstances can only be protected by granting the relief requested by
the Defendants.
[31]             
Order to issue as follows:
[32]             
In the event that the parties are unable to
resolve the issue of costs the following timeline applies:
