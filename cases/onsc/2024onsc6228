 The plaintiffs Johann Ingarra, Anthony Ingarra, John Paul Ingarra, Paul
Evans and Shaun Henderson bring this motion for default judgment in the amount
of $410,714.14, plus $25,000 in punitive damages, prejudgment interest and
costs. The plaintiffs also seek an order that pursuant to s. 178(1)(d) and (e)
of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. B-3, (the Act)
the judgment arises out of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation
while the defendants were acting as a fiduciary and therefore the judgment
survives any past, present or future assignment in bankruptcy.
[2]              
For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs are
entitled to the relief sought. I grant judgment in favour of the plaintiffs. I
order that the judgment survives bankruptcy.
[3]              
 The plaintiff Anthony Ingarra has known Nicholas Cartel and Singa Bui
since 2015. He is a registered mortgage agent with Pineapple Financial. He has referred
numerous clients to Mr. Cartel and Ms. Bui over the years in his capacity as
mortgage agent. The plaintiff John Paul Ingarra is a realtor and has known Mr.
Cartel and Ms. Bui since 2013. He has also referred numerous clients to the
defendants.
[4]              
The subject matter of this action relates to two loans. The first loan
was for $308,000 Anthony, John Paul and Johann Ingarra funded 35.1% or
$108,000, and Paul Evans funded 64.9% of $200,000. The loan was to be secured
by a mortgage over the property owned by the borrowers Waller Holding Inc.
located at 75 Fire Route 300, McKellar Ontario.
[5]              
The second loan was for $97,593.88. The funds were provided by Shaun
Henderson. The loan was to be secured by a mortgage over the property owner by
the borrower Toronto Church on the Rock Ministries located at 800 Simcoe E. St.
S., Oshawa, Ontario.
[6]              
 The first and second loans were to mature on December 1, 2023. On
December 1, 2023, deposits were made into the defendants’ trust account in the
amount of $97,593.88 and $313,150.28. The funds were not paid to the
plaintiffs. Anthony Ingarra states in his affidavit that he learned on December
4, 2023 that there were withdrawals made from the trust account on December 4,
2023 which had the effect of lowering the balance from $957,779.84 to
$356,110.29.
[7]              
On December 4, 2023, Anthony Ingarra sent an email to the mortgage broker
asking whether the first and second loans had been paid to the defendants on
December 1, 2023. Mr. Ingarra was advised that the transaction closed and the
funds had been paid into the Cartel & Bui trust account. Mr. Ingarra
contacted Mr. Cartel with respect to the payment of the funds. No payments were
made to the plaintiffs.
[8]              
The plaintiffs caused the statement of claim to be issued on April 12,
2024. On April 28, 2024, Michael Kestenberg wrote to Johann Ingarra and stated
that Mr. Cartel had authorized him to accept service on behalf of both Mr.
Cartel and the firm. Mr. Kestenberg also advised that Mr. Cartel had authorized
him to consent to judgment with respect to the Ingarra claims.
[9]              
The claim was served on Ms. Bui on May 1, 2024. Ms. Bui did not deliver
a defence. The plaintiffs requisitioned that Ms. Bui be noted in default. I am
satisfied that Ms. Bui was properly served with the claim. She did not defend
in the time permitted under the Rules. I exercise my discretion under Rule
2.01(1)(a) and 2.03 and note Ms. Bui in default.
[10]          
The plaintiffs bring this motion for default judgment under R.
19.02(1)(a). On a motion for default judgment, the court must undertake the
following inquiry:
[11]      Ms.
Bui was noted in default and is deemed to admit the following allegations of
fact in the statement of claim:
[12]      The deemed admissions
establish that Ms. Bui failed to pay the first and second loans to the
plaintiffs in accordance with her retainer. I am satisfied that the deemed
admissions establish the claim of breach of contract, fraud and
misappropriation as against Ms. Bui.
[13]      Ms. Bui is also deemed to
admit the allegation that she received funds from the first and second loans in
accordance with her fiduciary duty, and that she owed the plaintiffs a duty to
act with honesty and in good faith. I am satisfied that the deemed admissions
establish that she breached her fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.
[14]      Section 178(1) of the Act
provides as follows:
[15]      I am satisfied that the
deemed admission that she fraudulently misappropriated funds while acting in a
fiduciary capacity justifies an order under s. 178(1) of the Act that
the judgment survives any past, present or future assignment in bankruptcy and
that Ms. Bui shall not be released by any discharge from bankruptcy. I am
satisfied that this order is appropriate in the circumstances of this case even
though Ms. Bui has not yet declared bankruptcy: University Plumbing v.
Solstice Two Limited, 2019 ONSC 2242, at para. 23.
[16]      The plaintiffs seek judgment
in the amount of $410,744.16.  This was the amount that
was paid into the defendants’ trust account in payment of the first and second
loans. The money was not paid and was instead misappropriated by the defendants
[17]      The first loan was funded
35.1% by Anthony John Paul and Johann Ingarra and 64.9% was funded by Paul
Evans. A total of $313,150.46 was paid to the defendants’ trust account on
December 1, 2023 with respect to the first loan. Anthony, John Paul, and Johann
are entitled to 35.1% or $109,915.74. Paul Evans is entitled to 64.9% or $203,234.52.
The second loan was in the amount of $97,563.88. The funds for the second loan
were funded by Shaun Henderson.
[18]      I am satisfied that the
plaintiffs have proved their damages.
[19]      Based on the deemed
admissions I find that Ms. Bui breached her fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.
Instead of paying the funds to the plaintiffs in accordance with her retainer,
she misappropriated the funds for her own use. I am satisfied that Ms. Bui
acted in a manner that was callous, high-handed and reprehensible. Her conduct
is particularly egregious because at the time, she was a licenced lawyer and
officer of the court.
[20]      I award punitive damages to
the plaintiffs in the amount of $25,000. I allocated the punitive damages award
as follows: $6,250 to the plaintiffs Anthony, John Paul and Johann; $12,500 to
Paul Evans and $6,250 to Shaun Henderson. I am satisfied that an award of
punitive damages in this amount is appropriate to punish Ms. Bui for her
reprehensible conduct and to send the message that lawyers who defalcate trust
funds have more to lose than simply paying back their ill-gotten gains: IBEW,
Local 353 Trust Funds (Trustees of) b. Shojaei, 2014 ONSC 3656, at para.
16.
[21]      The plaintiffs are successful
on this motion and are entitled to their costs. The plaintiffs seek their costs
of the motion for default judgment on a partial indemnity rate in the all
inclusive amount of $2,500.  I am satisfied that the amount claimed by the
plaintiffs is reasonable and fair. I award costs to the plaintiffs fixed in the
amount of $2,500.
[22]      For the reasons set out
above, I make the following order:
[23]      I signed the draft order.
