[1]            This is an action that has had a long and tortured history before the Courts.  I have been involved in it since February of 2023.  At that time, I imposed a timetable on the parties.  That timetable limited them to bringing motions for undertakings and refusals, which were scheduled in 2023.  Those matters were heard by Doi J., who has released two decisions on these issues.
[2]           However, disputes still remain.  Specifically, there are disputes over the tracing orders that Doi J. issued for the mortgages on the property on Chickadee Lane as well as the follow up questioning that flowed from Doi J.’s previous order.  The Defendants say that they have provided everything necessary.  The Plaintiffs say that the Defendants have ignored Court orders, and that the Plaintiffs should be given leave to bring a motion to strike out the Statement of Defence.  The Plaintiffs also seek an order for the tracing of funds from the sale of the property on Chickadee Lane.
[3]           For the reasons that follow, I have determined that there are some additional steps that the Defendants should take in order to expand on and clarify the answers that they have already given as well as providing some answers to some written questions.  However, I have also determined that the other relief that the Plaintiffs have sought should be denied.  At this point, this matter needs to proceed to mediation and, ultimately, to trial.
[4]           In setting out my brief summary of the parties and the claim, I am not making any findings of fact.  My description is merely provided for the purposes of providing the background necessary to understand my disposition of these issues.  It expressly does not bind any judge hearing the merits of this dispute.
[5]           The Plaintiffs are all related to each other.  As a result, I will use first names when referring to individuals to avoid confusion.  No disrespect is intended by this.  Caroline Ansley is a cousin to Benedict and Myriam, who are brother and sister.  Mary is the mother of Benedict, and Anusha is Benedict’s wife.  Benedict passed away during the course of this litigation.
[6]           The Defendants are brothers.  At some point, these parties all had a close relationship.  I understand that Rajivan was involved in a relationship with Myriam for a number of years prior to the commencement of this litigation.  The relationship ended sometime in early 2017.  Anojan is Rajivan’s brother.
[7]           On the Plaintiff’s theory of the case, the Defendants Thillainadarajahs agreed to help the Plaintiffs Caroline and Myriam with the purchase of a property on Chickadee Lane in Caledon, because Caroline and Myriam were unable to obtain all of the necessary financing.
[8]           The Defendants have a different theory, which is that they had wanted to purchase the property and had asked Benedict to put an offer in on the property for them.  They describe a different history to the purchase, ownership and sale of the property than the Plaintiffs.
[9]           Ms. Vanee Harichandran Senthooran was the lawyer who acted for the Plaintiffs at various times during the course of this transaction.  She has generally been less involved in the procedural disputes than the other parties and her role in this matter is not relevant for the issues that I have to decide.
[10]        In any event, the property was purchased in June of 2013.  It was then leased and, ultimately, sold.  Mortgages were also placed on the property in this time period, allegedly for the profit of Rajivan and Anojan.  In January of 2017, Myriam and Rajivan’s relationship ended.  The Plaintiffs claimed that they had not received their portion of either the proceeds of sale from the property or the proceeds from the mortgages that were placed on the property.  The Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs were not entitled to any of these proceeds.
[11]        Although both the Thillainadarajahs and Ms. Senthooran are still involved in the action, this motion is between the Plaintiffs and the Thillainadarajah Defendants.  Therefore, when I refer to the Defendants throughout these reasons, I am referring to the Thillainadarajah Defendants.
[12]        This action was originally commenced by way of two Statements of Claim, which were issued on May 15th, 2017.  By way of an Order of Sproat J. on February 9th, 2018, the two actions were consolidated into one action.  Pleadings were ultimately closed in the consolidated action in May of 2018.
[13]        The action was brought by the Plaintiffs in respect of alleged breaches by the Defendants Rajivan and Anojan Thillainadarajah in respect of their alleged misappropriation of the proceeds of sale from the property as well as misappropriation of the proceeds from the second and third mortgages that were placed on the property in 2014.  The causes of action include fraud, claims of breaches of trust, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and other related claims.
[14]        The action against Ms. Senthooran is based on her involvement in this case as counsel.  She was involved in various parts of this transaction.  The Plaintiffs claim, in essence, that she failed to properly represent their interests in the purchase, mortgage and subsequent sale of the Chickadee Lane property.  The claim against her is for breach of contract and negligence.
[15]        Discoveries were held in the fall of 2020.  After these discoveries, counsel for the Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Law Society of Ontario about counsel for the Defendants, Ms. Biggar.  Ms. Biggar commenced a Court action against Mr. Feldman, the Plaintiffs’ counsel.  There were other issues that caused delays in this matter, including the passing of Benedict.  It is also abundantly clear to me that the relationship between counsel has been and remains fraught, to put it mildly.
[16]        This matter first came before me in February of 2023.  At that time, the Plaintiffs had brought a motion for a timetable to be imposed under Rule 48.  The motion was opposed, but I granted it.  I also made amendments to the timetable that the Plaintiffs had proposed.  Those amendments were designed to move this matter towards trial more promptly.
[17]        One of the key steps that I took in the timetable was to limit the motions that could be brought to motions in respect of unfulfilled undertakings and refusals.  A strict timetable was set for those matters, and they proceeded to a hearing before Doi J.  Both sides sought relief in respect of unanswered undertakings and items that had been refused.
[18]        One of the issues that Doi J. was asked to address was whether the Plaintiffs should be granted a tracing order in respect of the second and third mortgages.  He granted that order, stating:
[19]        In addition to that Order, Doi J. directed the parties to each provide other answers to undertakings that were not complete and questions that were improperly refused.  A deadline of forty-five days for the completion of these answers was imposed by Doi J.
[20]        On almost the first business day after the forty-fifth day had passed, July 5th, 2024, Defence counsel wrote to my judicial assistant seeking leave to bring a motion finding the Plaintiffs in contempt for failing to provide the answers directed by Doi J. in a timely manner.  I provided the parties with directions as to the further steps that were required to complete the undertakings and answers to refusals and scheduled a case conference for September 12th, 2023.
[21]        The Plaintiffs counsel then made it clear, in late July of 2023, that he was also seeking leave to bring a contempt motion against the Defendants because they had also failed to fully comply with the Orders of Doi J.
[22]        I addressed the contempt issues, along with other matters, at a case conference on September 12th, 2023.  I denied both parties leave to bring a contempt motion against the other party, on the basis that it would be very difficult to prove contempt (it is a criminal standard) and on the basis of the time that scheduling and hearing such a motion would consume.  That time would be better spent moving the matter towards trial.
[23]        There was also a dispute between the parties about the meaning of Doi J.’s tracing order.  I directed that dispute back to Doi J. for consideration, and he released an endorsement confirming that the tracing order applied to all documents in respect of the second and third mortgage in the possession, control or power of the Defendant.
[24]        There still remained some outstanding answers.  I addressed those issues from a procedural perspective at a case conference on January 10th, 2024.  I resolved some issues, provided the parties with directions as to how to resolve the remaining issues and advised the parties that any party who failed to produce a document at this point could not rely on it at trial, except with leave of the trial judge.
[25]        I also provided the parties with directions as to questioning arising from the answers to undertakings and the refusals that Doi J. had ordered answered.  That questioning was scheduled for May of 2024.
[26]        The matter came back before me at a case conference on July 16th, 2024.  At that time, I was advised that the questioning scheduled for May of 2024 had not been completed until the previous week.  While unfortunate, the delay was understandable and not related to the underlying problems in this case.
[27]        As a result, at the Case Conference on July 16th, 2024, I provided the parties with directions, as follows:
[28]        Those directions were not complied with.  When I reconvened the Case Conference on September 24th, 2024, I was faced with the fact that the Plaintiffs’ counsel had provided written questions that had to be answered, and that there were not (as yet) answers to those questions at least as far as I was aware.  There were also deficiencies with the materials provided for the tracing Order (as described below).  As a result, I provided the parties with further directions.
[29]        Based on those directions, I have received some (but not all) of the submissions I would have expected to receive.  The deadline for submissions was in November, so at this point I am going to provide the parties with my directions on the issues that have presented themselves for resolution.
[30]        Based on the materials that I have received, there are four issues that need to be addressed, as follows:
[31]        I will deal with each issue in turn.
[32]        There has been a great deal of discovery in this case.  As part of this process, I have asked for charts on a number of occasions.  The Rules of Civil Procedure spell out what is required in those charts, and it includes a column for the Court to record its disposition of the issues.  However, the charts filed by the Plaintiffs do not include such a column.
[33]        The Plaintiffs’ materials also contain a column outlining the position of the Plaintiffs on the answers given by the Defendants.  On some occasions, the position was that “no answer has been provided”.  On a few occasions, other deficiencies were noted.  Those questions I have considered in reaching my decisions.
[34]        However, on other occasions, the Plaintiffs have provided a quotation from some previous document.  Based on those quotations alone, I cannot tell whether Plaintiffs’ counsel is satisfied with the answer or not.  Given that these submissions were supposed to outline in one place all of the disputes, this lack of clarity is not helpful to the Court.  Where there is nothing in bold and/or no specific deficiency noted in the Plaintiffs’ charts, I have assumed that they are content with the answers that they have received and am providing no further relief to them.  Had the Plaintiffs wished to obtain additional information on those points, it should have been clearly outlined for the Court.
[35]        In his written submissions, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “the answers the Defendants have provided do not reflect an honest effort to provide us with the current location mortgage [sic] proceeds…”.  He also states, “Our position remains unchanged:  the majority of answers to our written questions remain outstanding or have been outright refused, and the tracing order regarding the proceeds of the subject mortgages remains unfulfilled.”
[36]        However, as I have described at paragraph 34, the Plaintiffs’ chart only points to specific deficiencies for some of the questions.  It is not the Court’s role to look at an answer and guess whether it is sufficient for the other party’s purposes.  I also note that I have provided relief in respect of the tracing order for the second and third mortgages, as described below.  There may be some duplication between what I have ordered in response to the specific written questions and the relief I have provided in the next section.
[37]          My usual approach in a motion of this nature would be to put my disposition of each disputed issue into a final column of an undertakings chart.  However, the document that the Plaintiff provided was also provided as a PDF (and not uploaded to CaseLines).  As a result, I am going to review the answers briefly by number as they appear in the Plaintiffs’ chart along with my disposition of them.  Where I have skipped numbers, I have specifically not found there to be any dispute.  It is not an omission, and I am neither requiring nor permitting any further submissions on issues that were not specifically addressed.
[38]        I should also make two general points in respect of all of these issues.  First, there are the principles that apply to all discovery issues.  Those are detailed in Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., 2011 ONSC 2504.  That decision sets out the principle that arguable relevance is the starting point, but not necessarily the finishing point for production decisions.  The Court must also ensure that the parties are not unduly burdened by their production obligations but that they can prepare their case and respond to the other party’s case.  Viele v. Gargan Investments Ltd., 2019 ONSC 2112 at para. 56.
[39]        This brings me to two more specific observations about the Plaintiffs’ requests in this case.  First, I am concerned about the breadth of some of these requests.  While it will be important to understand where the funds came from to buy this property, as well as where the funds from the mortgage went, it would not be proportionate to turn this proceeding into a complete investigation of the Defendants’ financial circumstances for the last ten years.
[40]        Second, I have specifically dealt with (and denied) the Plaintiffs’ request for a tracing order in respect of the sale proceeds for the Chickadee Lane property.  The reasons for that denial apply to various questions related to the sale proceeds from that property as well.
[41]        With that background in mind, I will now address the specific questions asked by the Plaintiffs that remain in dispute.  The issues in dispute and my disposition of them are as follows:
[42]        As can be seen, some of these questions need further clarification and further information, but the additional information that I am ordering the Defendants to produce is limited.  In answering these questions, I would also remind the parties of the general observations I made at paragraphs 36-40.
[43]        There are a couple of other issues that need to be addressed.  First, at paragraph 3 of his submissions, Plaintiff’s counsel raises concerns with the Defendants’ submissions.  Specifically, he states as follows:
[44]        There are two problems with the first half of this statement.  First, the fact that a question has been answered previously does not entitle the Plaintiff to have the answer repeated in another document.  Second, in any event, I have already described my concerns with the Plaintiffs’ submissions in this case.  Given those concerns, it is difficult to see how the Plaintiffs can obtain any relief by arguing deficiencies on the part of the Defendants.
[45]        In terms of the requirement for the answers to be put into an Affidavit, I am granting that request as it is a request that clearly fits within the Rules.  Discovery is under oath, and the same should be true for written discoveries.  However, I am also making it clear that having these answers put into an Affidavit does not provide the Plaintiffs with any rights to either conduct further cross-examinations or any other relief whatsoever.
[46]        Those Affidavits are to be provided within sixty (60) days of today’s date for both Defendants.
[47]        Some brief additional detail about the orders that were made on this issue are necessary.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs argues that the Defendants have not complied with the tracing order in respect of the second and third mortgages and seeks a further tracing order in respect of the sale proceeds.
[48]        In my July 16th, 2024, endorsement I provided the following directions in respect of the tracing order:
[49]        I also directed that I was to be copied on these letters.  I do not recall being copied on any correspondence, although it is quite possible that I was sent correspondence, as I had four different assistants between July 16th and September 12th, 2024.  When we reconvened the hearing, I raised that issue and was advised that Plaintiffs’ counsel had provided a letter on August 7th, 2024.  It stated, in part:
[50]        The letter does not identify any specific documentation that was missing, contrary to my directions.  It goes on to explain, in detail, why a tracing order is being sought on the sale proceeds as well.
[51]        At the case conference, although I had not seen this letter, I indicated that a letter that did not identify any specific missing documentation would likely not entitle the Plaintiffs to any further disclosure.  The letter reproduced above would not have been sufficient to justify any further Order.
[52]        However, at the case conference, I provided the Plaintiffs with a further opportunity to provide a list of the outstanding documentation within fourteen (14) days thereafter.  On October 7th, 2024, both Defendants’ counsel and I received a list of information from the Plaintiffs’ counsel, as follows:
[53]        This was a list that it was easier to respond to.  As a result, Defence counsel duly provided a response, which reads as follows:
[54]        While this response provides some information, I am of the view that more is necessary.  Specifically, it is not sufficient to say that the information can be obtained from TD Bank.  The Defendants have an obligation to both make efforts to obtain that information from TD Bank and to spell out those efforts for the Plaintiff.  To that end, I am ordering the Defendants to provide the following within sixty (60) days of today’s date:
[55]        However, there are some points in the Plaintiffs’ requests that should not have to be addressed.  First and foremost, there is no basis for a narrative report.  Second, once the Defendants records are searched and TD confirms what the Defendants’ counsel has said, this line of inquiry is at an end.
[56]        For clarity, I do not expect this list to produce much, if any, more documentation.  I am of the view, however, that the requests need to be addressed with more particularity.
[57]        Finally, these answers are also to be provided by way of Affidavit from the Defendants.
[58]        I start by noting, as Doi J. noted, that a tracing order is often a post-trial remedy.  In this case, Doi J. ordered a tracing order on the proceeds of the second and third mortgages to determine whether those proceeds were taken for the benefit of the Defendants.
[59]          Counsel for the Plaintiff argues that the fact that the tracing order was made for the proceeds of the mortgages means that it should be made for the sale proceeds as well.  There are two problems with this request, each one of which is sufficient for me to deny it.
[60]        First, Defendants’ counsel correctly points out that, if the Plaintiffs had also wanted a tracing order for the sale proceeds, they could have asked Doi J. to issue it.  They chose not to.  The parties should not be constantly re-doing their requests for production, especially in a case such as this where leave is required to bring further motions and the scheduling of undertakings and refusals motions was specifically dealt with at that time.
[61]        Second, it is not at all clear to me how the tracing order for the sale proceeds would assist in proving the Plaintiffs’ cause of action.  The monies from the sale of the property would have been used to discharge any mortgages or other encumbrances on the property.  The remainder would have been kept by the Plaintiffs.  That fact is not going to become clearer with a tracing order.  It is different than the mortgages, where the uses of the funds were both relevant and unclear.  In that respect, I note the claims that the Defendants made in paragraph 32 of their Fresh Amended Statement of Defence are the sort of claims that support the need for a tracing order.  Such support for a tracing order in respect of the sale proceeds is not obvious on the pleadings.
[62]        As Master Dash noted in Lafarge Canada v. McAdoo, 2009 CanLII 2035 at paras 21 and 22:
[63]        Generally, tracing orders are not granted prior to judgment.  In order to be relevant before judgment is granted, a tracing Order has to be relevant to the issues in dispute.  It is an exceptional remedy, and it is up to the Plaintiffs to demonstrate that it is justified on the facts of this case.  The Plaintiffs’ primary arguments are that, if the funds for the second and third mortgages should be traced, so should the sale proceeds.  There is no further explanation of that point and, as I have set out at paragraph 61, I do not find it persuasive.
[64]        For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ request for a tracing remedy on the proceeds of the sale is denied.
[65]        Counsel for the Plaintiffs acknowledges that this remedy would not be a remedy of first resort.  In fact, it is usually a remedy of last resort and the party against whom it is sought will have to be given an opportunity to cure any defect first.  The Court will also have to look at the circumstances as a whole:  Koohestani v. Mahmood 2015 ONSC 56, (2015) 2015 ONCA 56 (CanLII), 124 O.R. (3d) 205 at para. 54.
[66]        Counsel for the Plaintiffs points to Starland Contracting Inc. v. 1581518 Ontario Ltd., 2009 CanLII 30449 (ON SCDC).  In that case, the Court noted (at para. 26):
[67]        Counsel argues that permitting the Defendants to avoid providing the information required by the tracing Order would render those types of orders meaningless and would frustrate the Plaintiffs’ ability to prove their case.
[68]        The problem with this submission is twofold.  First, the Defendants have taken steps to disclose at least some of the information and they have taken further steps to demonstrate that other information that has been requested is not available.  Second, the trial Judge will have a number of other tools in their arsenal to address any non-disclosure that remains when this matter gets to trial.  To that end, I note that once the deadline for production of additional documents has passed, the parties will require leave from the trial judge to rely on anything further and adverse inferences may be drawn from a failure to produce documents.
[69]        In addition, it must be remembered what the Plaintiffs are seeking in this case.  First, they are seeking leave to bring a motion almost two years after a timetable was set in this matter.  This motion will undoubtedly further delay the litigation of this case.
[70]        Second, the Plaintiffs’ proposed motion, if successful, would result in the Plaintiffs succeeding on their action on the basis of a procedural, rather than a substantive, argument.  It is better, where possible, to have disputes resolved on their merits.  In this case, both parties have been distracted from the merits of the dispute on a number of occasions, including pursuing collateral actions, complaints to the LSO and contempt motions.  Given the likely outcome of this case, the parties’ efforts would be better expended moving this matter to trial.
[71]        For all of these reasons, the Plaintiffs’ request for leave to bring a motion to strike the Defendants’ Statement of Defence is denied.
[72]        For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant is to provide the additional information set out above.  The remainder of the Plaintiffs’ requests are dismissed.
[73]        For clarity, absent truly exceptional circumstances the discovery portion of this litigation is at an end once the steps that I have ordered are completed.  The parties have a mediation in March of 2025 and, if necessary, I may be spoken to afterwards in respect of any further timetabling that is required.  The parties should note that a trial date in this matter will need to be set, and it would be my expectation that this matter will be set down for trial in the first half of 2025 if it is not resolved at mediation.  This matter is clearly going to take five or more days, so it will be a blitz list matter.
[74]        Given the fact that success was divided on this matter and given the efforts that the Court had to take in order to ensure that the issues actually got adjudicated, it would seem to me that each side should bear their own costs for the preparation of these submissions.  In that respect, I specifically note that neither party has followed my directions as to how to prepare the materials to address this matter.
[75]        However, should either side be seeking costs, they may make costs submissions of no more than two (2) single-spaced pages, exclusive of bills of costs, offers to settle and case-law by no later than December 31st, 2024.  Those submissions are to be served, filed and uploaded to CaseLines.  Those submissions must address the failures of the party making the submissions to follow my instructions.
[76]        Each side may respond to a request for costs made by the other side in submissions that are also to be no more than two (2) single-spaced pages, exclusive of bills of costs, offers to settle and case-law.  Those submissions are to be served, filed and uploaded by January 10th, 2025.
[77]        There are to be no extensions for the time for costs submissions, even on consent, without my leave.  In the event that costs submissions are not received in accordance with the timetable set out above, there shall be no order as to costs for these issues.
[78]        I should also note that, in addition to serving, filing and uploading their costs submissions, counsel are also required to provide an electronic copy of them to my judicial assistant.  They will have received her e-mail with this decision.
[79]        Finally, I have noted that the most recent round of submissions has not been uploaded the CaseLines.  The parties are directed to upload their materials as soon as possible.
