[1]              
The accused, Sukhdeep Singh Sidhu (“Mr.
Sidhu”) and Inderjeet Singh (“Mr. Singh”), are each charged with one count of
unlawfully importing cocaine into Canada, contrary to s. 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (“CDSA”),
and one count of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, contrary
to s. 5(2) of the CDSA.
[2]              
On March 17, 2020, Canada Border
Service Agency (“CBSA”) officers discovered approximately 31 kilograms of
cocaine concealed in a shipment of citrus fruit being driven in tandem by the two
accused persons across the Canada/U.S. border at the Ambassador Bridge in
Windsor, Ontario.
[3]              
The cocaine was comprised of 31
bricks, each weighing approximately 1 kilogram. They were found in three boxes
loaded on a pallet in the near middle area of the refrigerated trailer being hauled
by both accused who were employed by a Brampton trucking business called Himalya
Express Inc (“Himalya Express”).
[4]              
There is no issue that the
substance found in the boxes was cocaine and that it was being imported into
Canada. The issue to be determined is whether the two accused individuals had
knowledge and control of the cocaine in the trailer and whether they were therefore,
at law, in possession of the contraband for the purposes of the CDSA.
[5]              
The trailer load of citrus fruit consisted
of 19 pallets, comprised of four shipments loaded onto the refrigerated trailer
at three different locations in central California.
[6]              
It is the position of the Crown
that the offences have been proved against both accused beyond a reasonable
doubt. The Crown submits that sometime after their arrival in California to
deliver shipments of frozen baked goods, the two accused came into possession
of the cocaine. At some point during the period between the time they picked up
the shipments of citrus fruit for the return trip, and before a seal was placed
on the trailer doors, they concealed the three boxes containing the cocaine at
the rear of one of the pallets of citrus fruit.
[7]             
The prosecution relies on circumstantial
evidence as proof of the knowledge of the accused truck drivers. Reliance on
circumstantial evidence to prove a person’s mental state, including knowledge,
is not unusual. As Culliton J.A. stated in R. v. Larier, 1960 CanLII 227 (SK CA), [1960] S.J. No.
116 (C.A.), at p. 312:
[8]              
As the case against the accused
individuals consists of circumstantial evidence, it is well settled that, in
order for a conviction to ensue, the guilt of each accused must be the only
rational inference to be drawn from the evidence. The existence of other
rational inferences need only raise a reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the
accused to prove an alternate theory. Inferences must be grounded in evidence
and logically linked to the underlying facts. They must not be too remote or speculative.
Finally, it is the cumulative weight of the evidence that must be considered in
determining whether the guilt of each accused has been proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.
[9]              
I note that on a charge of
importing, the Crown has the burden of proving that the accused had the
requisite mental intent to commit the act. In order to prove possession, the
Crown must prove two distinct elements: knowledge and control. Constructive
possession may be established where the accused does not, in fact, exercise control
over the object in question, but has power or authority over the object. The
right to grant or withhold consent to drugs being stored is sufficient for
constructive possession to be established. As the cocaine was in the
refrigerated trailer being hauled by the two accused individuals, this case
will rise or fall on the issue of knowledge. That
is, has the Crown proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that either, or both, of
the accused truck drivers knew the cocaine was in their trailer as they crossed
the international border into Canada?
[10]          
Counsel for both Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Singh submit that on
the evidence in this case the court should have reasonable doubt that their
respective clients had knowledge of the cocaine in the trailer. Accordingly,
the charges should be dismissed as the Crown has not proven control and knowledge
beyond a reasonable doubt.
[11]         
Accordingly, it will be necessary for the court
to look to the evidence adduced at trial to determine whether or not the Crown
has proven control and knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt.
[12]         
Evidence was taken at trial over nine days:
October 26 and 27, November 13 and 14, and December 4-8, 2023. Submissions were
held over two further days, March 11 and 12, 2024. A further two days were
required on August 1, 2024 and September 16, 2024 as I had questions that
needed to be addressed regarding some evidence that had not been addressed by
any of the counsel relating to Shipment #3.
[13]         
Sixteen exhibits were entered:
[14]         
 The court heard from several CBSA witnesses,
all called by the Crown. As well, the Crown called Mr. Hanaman Suruj from the
firm, Recochem Inc. (“Rechochem”), as a witness. Mr. Suruj was the Blending
Manager for this company that manufacturers and sells, inter alia,
windshield wiper fluid.
[15]         
Mr. Sidhu elected to testify. Mr. Singh did not
testify.
[16]         
I note as a preliminary matter that the accused
individuals used a logbook system in the truck that registered all times as
Eastern Standard Time (“EST”). Accordingly, when Mr. Sidhu gave evidence, he
related many times of events in EST, even for events which occurred in
California. I take notice that California is on Pacific Standard Time (“PST”),
three hours behind EST. However, many of the documents entered into evidence
appear to have times recorded locally, meaning some will be in PST. I have
attempted to specify the appropriate times where relevant to the narrative.
[17]         
I also note from the outset that different words
were often used in the testimony to describe similar items or events.  Unless
the context specifically requires otherwise, there is no discernable difference
in meaning with respect to the use of words such as, but not limited to:
tractor/truck, trailer/reefer, and shipment/load.  There were also different
words used to describe the cartons or boxes containing the citrus fruit. That
parlance will be explained later in this decision.
[18]         
Sukhdeep Singh Sidhu was a landed immigrant to
Canada at the time of the alleged offences. He came to Canada in February of
2017. He listened to the evidence and testified with the use of Punjabi interpreters.
[19]         
It is not disputed that Inderjeet Singh was also
in Canada as a landed immigrant. While Mr. Singh commenced the trial
proceedings in English, he eventually began hearing the testimony and
submissions through the use of Punjabi interpreters.
[20]         
Both accused individuals were qualified truck
drivers. At the time of the alleged offences, they were both employed by a
Brampton, Ontario based carrier known as Himalya Express Inc.
[21]         
 Mr. Sidhu has worked as a truck driver since
January, 2019. He started as a local “city” driver with Green Line Transportation
Inc. in Brampton, Ontario. He then worked as a long-haul driver for Roadstar
Trucking. He had been working as a long-haul driver with Himalya Express since May
2019. He drove trucks owned by Himalya Express back and forth between Ontario
and the United States.
[22]         
Prior to March 17, 2020, he had performed truck
driving services both as a solo driver and in tandem. As a tandem driver, he
and Mr. Singh had driven together in 2019 for Himalya.
[23]         
The trip from March 9, 2020 to March 17, 2020
was, however, the first time they had driven together in this particular
tractor.
[24]          
The evidence of Mr. Sidhu was that his English
language skills were not as proficient as those of Mr. Singh. For that reason,
when they crossed the border into the United States on March 9, 2020 and
returned into Windsor, Ontario on March 17, 2020, Mr. Singh was behind the
wheel of the tractor.
[25]          
As well, for
this same language reason, only Mr. Singh dealt with personnel at the various
delivery and pick-up locations. This assertion is supported by the fact that
Mr. Singh’s signature is on the bills of lading for the citrus fruit they
picked up to deliver to Canada.
[26]          
Another area of
responsibility was the overseeing of the shipments being loaded onto the
refrigerated trailer. Mr. Sidhu testified that he never watched or monitored
the loading of any of the four shipments of citrus fruit that were picked up. Also,
he was unable to advise if Mr. Singh monitored any of the four shipments that were
loaded.
[27]         
Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Singh were dispatched to
deliver a load to California, USA from Brampton. Specifically, on this outbound
trip, the accused individuals were hauling frozen baked goods being shipped by
Give And Go Prepared Foods Corp. on Finch Avenue in Toronto, Ontario.
[28]         
There were two consignees. They were C & S
Wholesale Grocers in Stockton, California and Superstore Industries, located in
nearby Lathrop, California.
[29]         
Stockton and Lathrop, California are
municipalities located east of the cities of San Francisco and Oakland,
California.
[30]         
This outbound trip commenced on the evening of
March 8, 2020 when they departed together from 252 Clarence Street in Brampton,
between 21:00 – 22:00 hours EST.
[31]         
The return trip involved picking up shipments of
citrus fruit in central California for delivery to Brampton.
[32]         
The accused were operating Himalya Tractor #820
(Exhibit 1-1-a) (Exhibit 1-1) (Note: The tractor number is noted
erroneously on the driver checklist (Exhibit #4) as #802).
[33]         
The tractor was equipped with driver and
passenger seats. 
There was also a lower and upper sleeping bunk situated in the rear of the cab
behind the seats. There were three larger storage areas in the tractor. There
was a centrally located storage space situated behind the passenger seats and under
the lower bunk. There were also two side spaces – one on each side of the
tractor. Those spaces could be accessed from the exterior of the tractor using
a key.
[34]         
The accused were hauling a 53-foot-long
refrigerated trailer (reefer) also marked with the Himalya Express logo
(Exhibit 1-1-a). The trailer number was 4023.
[35]         
The refrigeration unit was situated on the front
upper exterior of the trailer. When the tractor and trailer were coupled, the
refrigeration unit would be situated closest to the tractor. This is confirmed in
photograph Exhibit 1-20 as the refrigeration unit is visible at the front of
the interior of the trailer.
[36]         
I will refer to the portion of the trailer that
couples to the tractor to be the front (or head) of the trailer.
[37]         
The trailer contained no windows or other visible
points of entry other than the rear doors.
[38]         
Bill of Lading Packlist PL-394352 references 847
cases of frozen baked goods on 10 pallets to be delivered to C & S
Wholesale Grocers (C & S) in Stockton, California (Exhibit #5).
[39]         
Bill of Lading Packlist PL-393903 contained 420
cases of frozen baked goods on five pallets which were also being shipped to C
& S in Stockton (Exhibit #6).
[40]         
These two bills referenced the first shipments scheduled
to be delivered.
[41]         
Bill of Lading Packlist PL-394342 referenced
1,242 cases of baked goods on 15 pallets to be delivered to Superstore
Industries in Lathrop, California (Exhibit #2-16). This was scheduled to be the
second delivery.
[42]         
Various records seized from the tractor and the
testimony of Mr. Sidhu indicate that Mr. Singh drove the vehicle from Brampton.
The vehicle crossed the international border via the Ambassador Bridge in
Detroit, Michigan at 4:25 a.m. on March 9, 2020.
[43]         
The vehicle next stopped in Monroe, Michigan. This
location is approximately a one-hour drive southwest of Detroit, Michigan. Exhibit
1-7 is a copy of a receipt from Love’s Country Store in Monroe, Michigan dated
March 9, 2020, at 8:59 a.m. (Exhibit 2-20). At that time, the accused
individuals utilized a paid weigh scale that showed a weight of 66,580 lbs.
[44]         
Mr. Sidhu commenced driving at this point. He drove
the vehicle to Greenup, Illinois. At Love’s Store #688 in Greenup, they
purchased a combined total of $598.13 of diesel and reefer fuel for the trailer
(Exhibit 2-21).
[45]         
Mr. Singh then drove from Greenup to a location
in Oklahoma.
[46]         
Mr. Sidhu drove from Oklahoma to Albuquerque,
New Mexico. At Love’s Store #614 in Albuquerque, they purchased a total of
$516.52 of diesel and reefer fuel (Exhibit 2-5). That receipt is dated March
10, 2020, but no time is indicated.
[47]         
Mr. Singh took over the driving in Albuquerque until
they arrived at Barstow, California.
[48]         
Mr. Sidhu then drove from Barstow, California to
Stockton, California, the location of their first scheduled delivery.
[49]         
According to Mr. Sidhu’s testimony, he and Mr.
Singh arrived at their first scheduled delivery stop in Stockton, California at
09:00 EST on March 11, 2020. That time was two- and one-half hours later than
scheduled.
[50]         
As a result of being late, they were advised by
C & S Wholesale that as they had missed their delivery window they would
have to wait. That wait time was extended significantly. After four to five
hours passed without being able to deliver their first two shipments, the two
accused individuals spent overnight in Ripon, California. That is a town
located a short way southeast of Stockton.
[51]         
On March 12, 2020, they delivered their shipment
#3 to Superstore Industries in Lathrop, California. This was the reverse order
in which they were originally scheduled to deliver the goods.
[52]         
Next, they then returned to Ripon where they
re-fueled and waited for dispatch to give them information as to the Stockton
delivery.
[53]         
Sometime in the early morning of March 14, 2020,
Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Singh were able to deliver shipments #1 and #2 at C & S
Wholesale in Stockton (Exhibits 2-17 and 2-18). This completed the outbound
portion of their trip.
[54]         
The accused individuals departed Stockton for
their first pick-up. Exhibit 2-25 shows that their first pick-up location was in
Reedley, California at 13:50 PST on March 14, 2020. Reedley is situated
approximately 150 miles Southeast of Stockton. I note that it is generally
along the route that a vehicle would take if it was returning east through
Barstow, California. That is a location they had stopped at for fuel on the way
to Stockton.
[55]         
While it was contested for a portion of the
cross-examination of Mr. Sidhu, in submissions, it is not disputed that Mr.
Sidhu and Mr. Singh picked up four shipments of citrus fruit from three
shippers at three separate locations.
[56]         
The first product loaded was placed at the front
or head of the trailer.
[57]          
From the documentary evidence, photographs taken
by CBSA officials, and the testimony of Mr. Sidhu, the return trip to Canada
occurred as set out below.
[58]          
It is noted that the 19 pallets were identified
by the CBSA placing orange numbered cones on each pallet as the trailer was
searched. The 19 pallets contained cartons of citrus fruit loaded on to the
trailer.
[59]          
I note that the individual cartons of citrus
fruit are referred to as “cartons”, “crates”, “cases”, “boxes”, “CTNS” and
“Fullcart” in the documents and testimony. Those terms are to be treated
interchangeably in this decision unless I specifically reference otherwise.
[60]          
In reviewing the evidence, I have considered the
testimony of Mr. Sidhu, the various photographs of the inside of the trailer as
it was inspected by the CBSA officer, and the information contained in the
Bills of Lading.
[61]          
I also note that from the photographs, a full
pallet would hold 54 cartons. There would be six rows consisting of nine cartons
stacked on a pallet. Once six rows of cartons were stacked, the pallet would be
considered fully loaded and the entire stack of cartons would be shrink-wrapped
to stabilize the pallet and prevent the cartons from shifting or falling off
the pallet.
[62]          
The shipper for Shipment #1 was Fruition Sales
located in Reedley, California. This is shown by the Bill of Lading that is
Exhibit 2-25. There were three pallets of limes located at the front of the
trailer. Pallet 19 was loaded in the centre at the front of the trailer (Exhibit
1-20). Pallets 17 and 18 were loaded side by side, left to right respectively
(Exhibit 1-19). The Bill of Lading for this shipment shows 162 cartons of
limes. That is explained by three pallets, each containing 54 cartons.
[63]          
I start by noting that Shipment #2 was loaded in
Porterville, California. That location is approximately a one-hour drive south
of Reedley, California.
[64]          
The shipper for this load was Porterville Citrus
Inc. It would appear that while the shipment originated in Strathmore,
California, it was delivered to their facility in Porterville to be
consolidated with another Porterville Citrus Inc. shipment. Shipment #2 was
comprised of six (6) pallets of citrus fruit loaded at Porterville, California on
the afternoon of on March 14, 2020. This shipment is referenced at Exhibit
2-26. That invoice shows 324 cartons. That is, there are six pallets each
containing 54 cartons of lemons (4 pallets) and oranges (2 pallets).
[65]          
From the packaging observed on the photos, it
appears that pallet 16 was loaded in the center of the trailer (Exhibit 1-18). Pallets
14 and 15 were loaded beside each other from left to right as one looks to the
front of the trailer from the rear (Exhibit 1-17). Pallets 12 and 13 were
loaded beside each other from left to right (Exhibit 1-16). Finally, pallet 11
was loaded to the right side of the trailer (Exhibit 1-15).
[66]          
The shipper for this five (5) pallet shipment
was also Porterville Citrus Inc. It was also loaded at Porterville, California
on the afternoon of March 14, 2020 following Shipment #2.
[67]          
From the packaging observed in the photos, pallet
10 was loaded to the left of pallet 11 from Shipment #2 (Exhibit 1-15). Pallets
8 and 9 were loaded beside each other with 8 on the left (Exhibit 1-14).
Pallets 6 and 7 were then loaded beside each other with pallet 6 on the left-hand
side (Exhibit 1-8).
[68]          
Pallet 6 is of particular evidentiary
significance. It was at the rear of this pallet that the three boxes of cocaine
were located on inspection by the CBSA.
[69]          
From the various photos taken by the CBSA as the
trailer was unloaded, it can be ascertained that pallets 10, 9, 8 and 7 were
fully loaded. Each of these pallets was comprised of 54 cartons of oranges and was
shrink-wrapped. For example, from the photo at Exhibit 1-8, it is observed that
pallet 7 was fully loaded.
[70]          
However, it is also clear that pallet 6 was not fully
loaded. More specifically, it is readily apparent that the top two rows of pallet
6 were not full with nine cartons each.
[71]          
Exhibit 1-11 depicts pallet 6 after it was
unloaded from the trailer by the CBSA. From this photo, it can be ascertained
that several cartons from the highest and second highest layers were not present.
There are three other boxes not marked as citrus fruit located in that area.
These are the three boxes in which the 31 packages of cocaine were situated.
[72]          
A review of Exhibit 1-27 explains this configuration.
If all five pallets were full, this shipment would have totalled 270 cartons. That
calculation is made by multiplying five pallets by 54 cases or cartons. However,
the invoice for this shipment shows that it contained only 260 cartons.
[73]          
A notation on the invoice states:
[74]          
The invoice for these five pallets references
“80 MT. WHITNEY CENTR SK MINNEOLA”.
[75]          
The pictures of pallet 6 show the carton marked
“MT. WHITNEY.”
[76]          
There is a marking “MINN” which I have concluded
is short for “MINNEOLA”.
[77]          
As well, it is observable that the
shrink-wrapping on pallet 6 was secured in a way that angled downward to
account for the fact that there were not 54 cartons on the pallet.
[78]          
The time of departure for Shipments #2 and #3
from Porterville is listed as 19:06 PST on March 14, 2020.
[79]          
It is noted that after completion of Shipment
#3, the configuration of the pallets was such that pallet 6 (on the left) and pallet
7 (on the right) would have been at the rear of the trailer, as it then was. There
is no evidence to suggest that this configuration would not have remained in
place until the final shipment (#4) containing five pallets was loaded onto the
trailer.
[80]          
The shipper for this five (5) pallet load (containing
270 cartons) was Visalia Citrus Packing Group in Woodlake, California. I start
referencing this shipment by noting that Woodlake, California is located
approximately 35 minutes of driving south of Porterville, California. Based on
the departure time from Porterville at 19:06 PST, the vehicle being operated by
the two accused would have arrived at Woodlake at approximately 19:45 or 19:50
PST.
[81]          
From the packaging observed in the photos, pallets
#4 and #5 were located beside each other (Exhibit 1-6). Pallet #3 was loaded in
the center of the trailer (Exhibit 1-5(b)). Pallets 1 and 2 were loaded beside
each other, also left to right (Exhibit 1-5(a)).
[82]         
There was no other commercial freight loaded on
this trailer.
[83]         
Exhibit 2-28 shows the time out for this load as
20:23 PST on March 14, 2020.
[84]         
Given these estimates of time, it would appear
that the subject vehicle would have been at Woodlake, California for no more
that 30 to 35 minutes.
[85]          
It is normal practice that once freight on
pallets is loaded onto a trailer, strapping is used to prevent the individual
cartons of product or the actual pallets of freight from shifting or otherwise
becoming unstable. The evidence discloses that the trailer used in this matter
was equipped with the necessary strapping.
[86]         
The normal practice would be to strap the first
shipment when loaded to keep it secure as the vehicle begins travelling. The
strapping would then be resituated at the rear at the end of each shipment
being loaded at the most rear portion of the load. In this manner, it is
observable in the photographic evidence taken by the CBSA (Exhibits 1-2 and
1-5) when the trailer was examined in Windsor that the strapping was affixed to
pallets 1 and 2 at the rear of the load.
[87]          
It is standard in the trucking business that
shippers use numbered, wire-based seals to secure the trailer doors on loads.
[88]          
There are numerous purposes for using such
seals.
[89]          
Firstly, they restrict access to the trailer by
unwelcome third parties. Once a trailer has a seal placed and the number
recorded, the driver or, as in this case, the drivers, have protection against
the interior of the trailer being breached.
[90]          
A properly affixed seal can only be removed with
a suitable wire cutter. Furthermore, if an unauthorized person breaks into the
trailer, the destruction of the seal provides proof for the drivers that the
load has been tampered with on inspection.
[91]          
As well, when crossing the international border,
it is understood that the trailer must contain a seal. The seal provides the
same level of comfort to both the CBSA officials and the driver that the load
has not been tampered with following loading.
[92]          
The normal protocol for the use of a seal would
be for the operators to place a seal on the trailer after the shipment has been
fully loaded. If the operator notifies their employer (or customer in certain
instances) of the seal number, both parties are protected in the event there is
an issue with the load.
[93]          
It is noted that on the outbound load, the
frozen baked goods that were being delivered were in a trailer that had a seal
placed on it from departure.
[94]          
At 20:59 PST the vehicle was at Tulare,
California. The logbook indicated this was midnight EST, or 9:00 p.m. PST.  Mr.
Singh was the driver. Tulare is located a short distance southwest of Woodlake,
California, the location of the last pick up. Exhibits 2-4 and 2-29 show that
they had the vehicle weighed at 77,220 pounds.
[95]          
Mr. Singh continued driving from Tulare to
Barstow, California. From there, Mr. Sidhu operated the vehicle to Kingman, Arizona.
Exhibits 1-26, 1-27 and 2-33 show that they purchased $568.43 of diesel and reefer
fuel in Kingman.
[96]          
Mr. Sidhu continued driving to somewhere in New
Mexico that was not noted in the logbook. Mr. Singh then commenced driving.
[97]          
Somewhere in Oklahoma, Mr. Sidhu stated Mr.
Singh stopped to ask if Mr. Sidhu could drive as they were two and one-half
hours behind schedule.
[98]          
Mr. Sidhu then drove from that point to a Love’s
Station in Rolla, Missouri. Exhibit 2-34 shows they purchased $518.20 of diesel
and reefer fuel.
[99]          
Mr. Sidhu continued driving until they were
somewhere in Illinois. Mr. Singh then drove the balance of the trip to Windsor.
[100]      
Along the way, at a Love’s Station near Detroit,
Michigan, Mr. Sidhu testified they stopped, and he put a seal on the trailer
for the first time.
[101]      
Mr. Singh continued driving at this point. The
next stop was at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor where the vehicle was
eventually diverted for inspection and searched. It was at this point the
cocaine was discovered.
[102]      
The cocaine was discovered in three boxes. Two
of the boxes were Home Depot boxes. The third box was made to hold containers
of windshield wiper fluid made by a Brampton based company called Recochem Inc.
[103]      
Mr. Hanaman Suruj was the Blending Manager for
this company. He testified that the box was designed to hold cartons of their
Turbo Power Windshield Wiper Fluid. He explained that this product and the
boxes are made in Canada and are for sale only in Canada. He gave some detailed
evidence explaining the coding on the box (Exhibit 3) and a partial container
of the Turbo Power Windshield Wiper Fluid (Exhibit 11). From the coding, it
would appear the box and wiper fluid were manufactured at almost the same time.
While the exact times did not exactly align, I am satisfied that Exhibit 3 was
a Recochem box made in Canada to hold containers of their Turbo Power product,
and that product is not sold in the United States.
[104]     
As indicated, Mr. Sidhu testified in this matter
in his own defence.
[105]     
I will review his evidence in detail and conduct
a W.(D.) analysis.
[106]     
Mr. Sidhu stated that his level of English
comprehension and understanding was limited. He also stated that Mr. Singh had a
better understanding of English. For this reason, whenever they crossed the
border, or dealt with shippers and/or receivers, Mr. Singh handled those
duties.
[107]     
Both he and Mr. Singh drove the tractor, taking
turns. Mr. Singh began driving at Woodlake, California. Mr. Sidhu took over at
Barstow, California and drove to a stop in Kingman, Arizona and then onto
somewhere in New Mexico. Mr. Singh drove to Rolla, Missouri and Mr. Sidhu drove
from Rolla to somewhere in Illinois. Then, Mr. Singh drove to the border in
Windsor, Ontario.
[108]     
At no time when the trailer was being loaded with
any of the four shipments did Mr. Sidhu watch any of the loading process.
[109]     
At no point on the return trip did Mr. Sidhu
affix or fasten strapping to the load.
[110]     
At no point did Mr. Sidhu check to see if the
strapping was affixed after they received load #1 in Reedley, California before
they travelled to Porterville, California to pick up loads #2 and #3. This is a
distance of approximately 50 miles.
[111]     
At no point did Mr. Sidhu check to see if the
strapping was affixed after they received loads #2 and #3 in Porterville,
California before travelling to pick up shipment #4 in Woodlake, California.
This is a distance of approximately 30 miles.
[112]     
At no point following the loading of shipment #4
in Woodlake, California did Mr. Sidhu check to see if the load was strapped. At
no point did Mr. Sidhu testify that Mr. Singh ever affixed strapping or did he
observe Mr. Singh inspect the trailer to ascertain if the load had been
strapped.
[113]     
In his testimony, Mr. Sidhu insisted that both
shipments #2 and #3 were loaded at the facility in Porterville, California.
[114]     
In cross-examination, Crown counsel spent
considerable time suggesting that the load of 324 boxes on six pallets (Load
#2) was loaded at a fourth location. Exhibit 2-26 indicates that shipment was
from Strathmore, California.
[115]     
What Mr. Visca missed, however, was a notation
on the Bill that the shipment was to be delivered to Porterville for
consolidation with shipment #2.
[116]     
It was also noted by Mr. Sidhu on page 2 of the
Bill of Lading that the load had been transported to Porterville by a person
named “Fidel”. Fidel was not called as a witness.
[117]     
In the end, the Crown acknowledged that Mr.
Sidhu’s testimony in this respect was correct.
[118]     
On the evidence of Mr. Sidhu, he stated that even
though the last load of citrus fruit was placed on the trailer on March 14,
2020 in Woodbridge, California, neither he nor Mr. Singh affixed a seal to the
trailer until March 17, 2020, in Michigan, at the last stop before the vehicle
crossed back into Canada. According to Mr. Sidhu, he affixed the seal.
[119]     
He had an explanation for not affixing the seal
once the last of the pallets was loaded onto the trailer in California. He
indicated that he previously was docked pay for a load by his employer when a
load he was transporting shifted during travel and some product was damaged. By
not sealing the trailer, either he or Mr. Singh could freely enter the trailer,
if necessary, without having to remove the seal and reposition the freight to
avoid the load shifting and therefore avoid them being docked pay if there was
damage.
[120]     
He acknowledged that by not sealing the trailer,
there was nothing to prevent someone from physically opening the trailer doors
while the vehicle was stopped by simply lifting the rear latch to which the
seal can be attached and opening the doors to the trailer.
[121]     
He did not testify that either he or Mr. Singh
checked inside the trailer to see if the load had shifted at any time while en
route from Woodlake, California to Windsor, Ontario.
[122]     
As indicated, Mr. Sidhu eventually put a seal on
the trailer when the vehicle was stopped at a Love Station in Michigan on March
17, 2020.
[123]     
The seal that was on the trailer when it was
opened by the CBSA contained the number C06213 (Exhibit 2-1(a) and 2-1(b)).
[124]      
As well, there were various seals located in the
tractor of the vehicle. Exhibits 2-2(a), (b) and (c) depict unused red seals
that were removed on inspection by the CBSA.
[125]      
Mr. Sidhu testified that he checked the seal he
affixed to the trailer to the paperwork sharing the seal number as prepared by
Mr. Singh.
[126]      
There were two flattened Sunkist boxes located
by CBSA officer in the centre storage unit of the tractor. The markings on
those boxes do not match up with any of the product being shipped. Mr. Sidhu
testified they would use these empty boxes if they had to crouch under the
tractor or trailer for any reason as protection from substances on the ground.
[127]      
In cross-examination, it was suggested, and Mr.
Sidhu agreed, that they both had access to a seal cutter on the tractor
(Exhibit 1-37) and (Exhibit 2-10).
[128]      
He agreed that the cocaine found in the trailer
would have remained in an unsealed trailer from whenever it was put there until
he put the seal on in Michigan.
[129]      
He stated he did not know if the cocaine was
there or not but stated the seal was placed on at the Love Station in Michigan.
[130]     
Mr. Sidhu testified that Mr. Singh put the
number of the seal on the border crossing paperwork.
[131]      
The following exchange then occurred:
[132]      
Mr. Sidhu testified that approximately three
weeks before the trip that resulted in these charges, he began using the
Recochem box (Exhibit #3) to hold garbage in the tractor. The box fit between
the driver seat and passenger seat but was closer to the passenger seat.
[133]      
Sometime between their arrival in Stockton, California
and their final delivery of baked goods delayed to March 14, 2020, Mr. Sidhu
noticed that the glue on the bottom of that box was coming off.
[134]      
He taped the bottom of the box to make it more
secure. He used tape from the tape dispenser seized by the CBSA from the tractor
(Exhibit #12).
[135]      
He does not know if Mr. Singh was present when
this taping occurred.
[136]      
He did not tape the top of the box.
[137]      
He did not tape the box to put drugs in it.
[138]      
He did not place a seal on the trailer after the
final shipment of citrus fruit was loaded on the truck in California.
[139]      
At no point on the return trip did he notice
that the box he was using for garbage and that he taped in California was
missing from the tractor. That was his explanation for how his fingerprint was innocently
on the tape.
[140]      
Mr. Sidhu testified that whenever the vehicle
was stopped for fueling, food, resting or washroom breaks and both accused
individuals were out of the tractor at the same time, it was always locked. As
well, throughout the trip, they were only separated from each other when the
vehicle was stopped and while they used the washroom or showered. Otherwise, when
the vehicle was stopped, they were together eating or were together when
outside the tractor.
[141]      
At each of the three locations from which they
picked up citrus fruit, it was Mr. Singh who went into the shipping office and
dealt with the shippers. Whenever this occurred, Mr. Sidhu stayed in the
tractor. He made no observations of the shippers loading the reefer, no observations
of the placement of any of the 19 pallets, no observations of the pallets on
the trailer, nor the placement of any strapping.
[142]     
There is no dispute that on inspection of the
trailer being operated by the two accused individuals that there were three
boxes in the refrigerated trailer containing 31 bricks of cocaine weighing 1 kg
each. As well, it is not disputed that the accused individuals picked up four
loads of citrus fruit from three locations.
[143]     
I will start my review of this evidence by
reviewing the evidence and information obtained and provided by the CBSA officers
who conducted the secondary inspection.
[144]     
Officer Ciota has been a CBSA employee since
2007.
[145]     
On March 17, 2020, he was involved in conducting
a secondary inspection of the relevant trailer being hauled by the two accused.
He did this at the CBSA facility on Industrial Drive in Windsor. Officer Ciota
was accompanied by Officers Beaumont and Pruyron at this time.
[146]     
He commenced the inspection at 5:15 a.m.
[147]     
The trailer had been backed up close to the
loading dock #10.
[148]     
He cut the seal on the trailer (Exhibit 2-1). The
truck was shut off and the accused both went to the waiting room. He made a
note that the seal was C06213. He was aware from the paperwork of the nature of
the shipment.
[149]     
Exhibit 1-2 is a photograph taken with the seal
removed and the rear doors to Trailer #4023 open. The picture depicts cartons
of citrus fruit stacked on pallets. The boxes on the pallet are shrink-wrapped together
to secure them. They are stacked on pallets located side by side, with a few
exceptions.
[150]     
There was a strapping located across the two visible
pallets.
[151]     
The pallets were loaded with the sides of two
boxes facing the back of the trailer and one box facing the side. In this
configuration, there were nine boxes per layer. Above that were five additional
levels of boxes. Accordingly, a fully loaded pallet contained 54 boxes or
cartons of citrus fruit.
[152]     
All of the cartons on each pallet were fully
shrink-wrapped with one significant exception that was referenced with respect
to pallet #6.
[153]     
The picture at Exhibit 2-1 also indicated that a
step ladder was put on the floor of the trailer by the Officer. This ladder was
used by Officer Ciota to perform a task he described as “crawl the load.”
[154]     
The Officer would use the step ladder to get to
the top of the loads and then crawl along the space between the top of the
boxes and the roof of the trailer to work his way from the rear to the front of
the trailer.
[155]     
It is noted that the pallets were loaded on the
trailer in a certain configuration. This is apparent from photographs taken
when the trailer was examined.
[156]     
The loading also conformed to the order that the
pallets were configured on the trailer.
[157]     
From the rear of the trailer to the front, the
following was observed and noted with numbered orange pylons:
[158]     
These pallets would be loaded in the reverse
order of the numbering from the front of the trailer nearest the tractor to the
rear. That is, pallet #19 would be the first loaded and pallets #1 and #2 would
be the last loaded.
[159]     
It is noted from the photographs in Exhibit 1 of
the following:
[160]     
A review of the Bills of Lading demonstrates the
configuration of the pallets as loaded on the trailer. The shipper for load #1
was Fruition Sales located in Reedley, California. There were three pallets of
limes (162 boxes) located at the front of the trailer. Pallet 19 was loaded in
the centre of the trailer, and pallets 17 and 18 were loaded side by side
(Exhibit 2-25).
[161]     
There were three boxes containing a total of 31
– 1 kilogram bricks of cocaine in the trailer.
[162]     
The cocaine has a value of $55,000 per kilogram
when sold in that manner.  That would total $1,705,000. If broken down and sold
on the street, each kilogram is worth $100,000 of $3.1 million in total.
[163]     
Two of the boxes were branded “Home Depot”. The
third box (Exhibit 3) was labelled as containing 4 x 3.78 of Turbo WWAA Antigel
Pour or Lave-Glace as indicated earlier.
[164]     
The box was used by Recochem to hold containers
of 3.78 litres of Turbo Power Windshield Washer Fluid (Exhibit 11).
[165]     
This box contained several bricks of cocaine.
[166]     
Notably, there was clear packing tape affixed to
the top and the bottom of the box. On investigation, a single fingerprint of
Mr. Sidhu was detected on the tape situated on the bottom. That evidence is not
disputed by Mr. Sidhu, although as indicated he provided the court with an
explanation for how that box with tape affixed to the bottom with his
fingerprint was discovered in the back of the sealed trailer.
[167]     
There was a dispensing roll of clear tape of the
same colour and shape as the tape on the Recochem box that contained Mr.
Sidhu’s fingerprint (Exhibit 12) located in the tractor.
[168]     
The tractor also contained a set of wire cutters
capable of cutting a truck seal (Exhibit 2-10).
[169]     
The parties filed a written Agreed Statement of
Facts (“ASF”)( Exhibit #16). I will refer to these admissions as required in
the course of my analysis of the evidence and the law. In pertinent part, the
following facts are agreed:
[170]     
A fingerprint that was identified to Mr. Sidhu
was found on the clear packing tape of one of the boxes containing cocaine –
the box that had contained windshield wiper fluid (“the box” (Trial Exhibit
#3)). At the time of testing, the tape was slightly detached from the box in
this area, and the fingerprint that was identified to Mr. Sidhu’s left index
finger (identified as R36) was found on the edge of the sticky side of the
tape, the side facing the box. Mr. Sidhu’s fingerprint was located on a piece
of tape that secured the bottom of the box. (See photo with green box and
arrow, Trial Exhibit #1 (38) i.e. Volume 1; Tab 38)).
[171]     
Among the items seized from the cab was packing
tape with a dispenser (Trial Exhibit #12). A piece of tape attached to the box
(not the piece of tape with Mr. Sidhu’s fingerprint) and the tape ending from
the roll of tape in the dispenser were at one time, one continuous piece of
tape. The end of the tape on the box that matched the end of the tape from the
dispenser secured the top of the box. The end of the tape on the box that
matched the end of the tape in the dispenser is identified on the box with a
yellow sticker arrow and scale (See photo, Trial Exhibit #1 (38) i.e. volume 1;
Tab 38).
[172]     
35 other finger impressions were located on (1)
various plastic wrappings used to package the cocaine; and (2) a Sunkist
cardboard box. Mr. Sidhu is excluded as the source for the other fingerprint
impressions.
[173]     
The Crown has not proven the case against Mr.
Sidhu beyond a reasonable doubt.
[174]     
As this is a circumstantial case, in order to
convict, the court must be satisfied on the evidence as a whole that the guilt
of Mr. Sidhu is the only reasonable conclusion available. In R. v. Villaroman,
2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 30, the court stated as follows:
[175]     
Any inferences must be drawn properly and cannot
be based on speculation.
[176]     
Counsel emphasized that the trailer would be
noisy with the refrigeration unit operating. It was noted that the Sunkist
boxes discovered in the central storage compartment did not match the boxes
used for any of the loads of citrus being hauled in this instance.
[177]     
Counsel noted that the Recochem windshield wiper
fluid and the Recochem box found with the cocaine with Mr. Sidhu’s fingerprint
on it were made in Canada. However, she emphasized that based on the time
stamps on the box and the wiper fluid container, they were made at slightly
different times.
[178]     
Mr. Sidhu testified in his own defence, and his
counsel asserts he was a credible witness, notwithstanding that he had some
language issues.
[179]     
He has an innocent explanation for his
fingerprint being on the tape on the box containing some of the cocaine and he
should be believed. Counsel submitted someone other than him, including possibly
Mr. Singh (who had equal access to the tractor), could have used the box to
store the cocaine and place it at the back of pallet #6 without Mr. Sidhu
knowing.
[180]     
It is a reasonable inference that Mr. Singh
could have put the box in the trailer with the cocaine.
[181]     
It is also a reasonable inference that a third
party took the box from the tractor, put cocaine inside it, and placed the box
with the two Home Depot boxes on pallet #6.
[182]     
Because there are other reasonable inferences,
the court cannot conclude that the only reasonable inference is that Mr. Sidhu
placed the cocaine in the trailer.
[183]     
Counsel stressed that there was no evidence
called by the Crown with respect to the loading of the trailer at Reedley,
Porterville or Westlake, California. Furthermore, there was no evidence
provided by anyone from Himalya Express.
[184]     
Counsel explained away the inconsistencies in
the evidence of Mr. Sidhu regarding his statement in examination-in-chief and
in cross-examination by Mr. Marley (for Mr. Singh) that it was four years later
when he testified, and he just corrected an error. On an objective review, this
does not reduce his credibility.
[185]     
Mr. Marley, counsel for Mr. Singh, relies on the
submissions made by Mr. Sidhu.
[186]     
Additionally, his counsel notes that there is no
eyewitness evidence or any other evidence directly linking Mr. Singh to the
boxes of cocaine. There is also no evidence of anyone involved in the loading
of the four shipments of citrus fruit in California. As well, he notes, there
was no testimony from anyone at Himalya Express.
[187]     
He suggests there is a strong inference that
someone in the Toronto area knew what was going on and was waiting for the
cocaine to arrive once it cleared the border.
[188]     
The inference that persons in Porterville knew
about the shipment of cocaine was not dispelled by the prosecution.
[189]     
The court should accept the evidence regarding
the time when the seal was placed on the trailer. Beyond that, the Crown cannot
prove that either Mr. Singh (or Mr. Sidhu, for that matter), had knowledge and
control of the cocaine.
[190]     
Mr. Marley noted that by looking at the loaded
trailer from the ground, a person could not see the boxes of cocaine. There is
no evidence that Mr. Singh had knowledge of the cocaine and, as a result, he did
not have control. It would be dangerous for the court to draw the inferences
necessary to convict.
[191]     
The Crown has established on the evidence that
the two accused had both control and knowledge of the cocaine in the trailer.
[192]     
Control in this case is straightforward as the
cocaine was contained in a trailer that was sealed and was being transported by
the two accused.
[193]     
The court can infer knowledge from the
circumstantial evidence. It should do so in this case.
[194]     
Having said that, to establish guilt on the
circumstantial evidence in this case, the court must be satisfied on the
evidence that guilt is the only reasonable conclusion available: see Villaroman.
[195]     
To that extent, an alternative inference
sufficient to give rise to reasonable doubt must be reasonable and not just
possible.
[196]     
In conducting a W.(D.) analysis, the
court must assess all three prongs of the analysis along with all of the other
evidence presented at trial.
[197]     
In this case, the court should not be left in a
reasonable doubt by the evidence of Mr. Sidhu because it cannot be reconciled
with the entirety of the evidence.
[198]     
Accordingly, Mr. Sidhu’s evidence that he did
not know about the cocaine and that he taped the Petrochem box to better its
use as a garbage container rather than be fortified to hold cocaine, must be
examined in the context of the totality of the evidence.
[199]     
While some of Mr. Sidhu’s evidence is
acceptable, the overarching feature of that evidence is that it was mostly
verified by documentary evidence contained in the tractor (such as logbooks,
Love’s receipts and weigh-scale tickets) and items found in the tractor (i.e.,
tape dispenser, seal cutter and seals).
[200]     
It can also be accepted that Mr. Singh did the
communicating with officials because of his superior English language skills,
and that they always locked the trailer.
[201]     
However, when considered on the totality of the
evidence, Mr. Sidhu’s assertion that he had no knowledge of the cocaine fails
when considered in light of all of the evidence. More specifically, his
evidence that he taped the bottom of the Petrochem box for garbage purposes
rather than tape it to hold cocaine does not make sense on the totality of the
evidence in this case.
[202]     
As well, if someone other than Mr. Sidhu
converted Exhibit 3 after Mr. Sidhu taped the bottom in and around Stockton,
California, that such person would then locate and substitute use another box
to store garbage in the tractor is implausible.
[203]     
Furthermore, that someone would deliver two Home
Depot boxes with cocaine to the trailer and then excrete a third box from the
tractor to load it with cocaine is even more implausible.
[204]     
The testimony with respect to strapping the load
at each stage of the pick-ups was also implausible.
[205]     
For all these reasons the Crown has been able to
establish on the totality of the evidence that the only reasonable conclusion
is that Mr. Sidhu took the Rechochem box from the tractor and taped it for
reinforcement to hold several kilos of cocaine and then either placed the three
boxes at the back of Pallet #6 or worked in conjunction with Mr. Singh and
possibly others in this endeavour. In either instance he clearly had knowledge
that there was cocaine in the trailer when it entered into Canada.
[206]     
The essential elements of the crime of importing
a controlled substance, contrary to s. 6(1) of the CDSA, the controlled substance in this
case being cocaine, are as follows:
[207]     
The essential elements
of the crime of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2)
of the CDSA, the controlled substance in this case being cocaine, are as
follows:
[208]     
Pursuant to s. 2(1) of
the CDSA, possession is defined as “mean[ing] possession within the
meaning of subsection 4(3) of the Criminal Code.” Subsection 4(3) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, provides, in pertinent part as
follows:
[209]     
In crimes of unlawful possession, the Crown may
prove the required knowledge element by circumstantial evidence: see R. v.
Pham (2005), 2005 CanLII 44671 (ON CA), 77 O.R. (3d) 401 (C.A.), aff’d 2006 SCC 26, [2006] 1
S.C.R. 940. The trier of fact must be satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the only rational or reasonable
inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial evidence is guilt; the mere
existence of any rational or reasonable inference other than guilt drawn from
the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt: see R.
v. Griffin, 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at paras. 33-34 as
follows:
[210]     
Other inferences need not arise from proven
facts but “must be based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or the
absence of evidence, not on speculation”: Villaroman, at para. 37. This
assessment standard applies to the total body of evidence and not to individual
pieces of evidence: see R. v. Al-Kazragy, 2018 ONCA 40, [2018]
O.J. No. 573, at para. 27.
[211]     
 The enhanced mental element for this crime relates
to the purpose of the possession of the controlled substance; the possession must
be for the purpose of trafficking.
[212]     
 “Traffic” is defined in s. 2(1) of the CDSA
and includes “to sell, … give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the
substance”.
[213]     
Both accused entered pleas of not guilty. They are presumed in law to be innocent of the
charge. This presumption is a cornerstone of our criminal justice system. This
presumption of innocence stays with the accused
individuals throughout their trial and can only be
defeated if and when Crown counsel satisfies me by the heaviest burden known in
law, beyond a reasonable doubt, that either Mr. Sidhu, Mr. Singh, or both are guilty of either or both of the
charges.
[214]     
This heavy burden of proof never shifts; it is
always on the Crown. The Crown brought the charges against these individuals; they
must prove the allegations. The accused do not have to prove anything; they do not have to present evidence; they
do not have to testify. It is the Crown who must prove every essential element
beyond a reasonable doubt before I can find Mr. Sidhu and/or
Mr. Singh guilty of any crime.
[215]     
A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary,
far-fetched, or frivolous doubt. It is not a doubt based on sympathy for or
prejudice against anyone involved in this trial. It is a doubt based on reason
and common sense. It is a doubt that logically arises from the evidence or the lack
thereof.
[216]     
It is not enough for me to believe that either
accused is probably or likely guilty. In those circumstances, I must find either
or both of the accused individuals, as the case may be, not guilty, because
Crown counsel would have failed to satisfy me of their guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. Proof of probable or likely guilt is not proof of guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.
[217]     
However, I must also remember that it is nearly
impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty. Crown counsel is not
required to do so. Absolute certainty is a standard of proof that is impossibly
high. However, having said that, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is closer to
proof to an absolute certainty than it is to proof on a balance of
probabilities.
[218]     
When an accused elects to testify on his own
behalf, as Mr. Sidhu did in his trial, I must assess the evidence in accordance
with the well-known principles from R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,
as follows:
[219]     
Credibility and reliability are not identical
concepts. Credibility refers to the honesty of a witness. Reliability refers to
the accuracy of a witness’s evidence. A witness may be honest but wrong. I must
consider both the credibility and reliability of each witness.
[220]     
Where there are significant inconsistencies or
contradictions within a witness’s testimony, or when considered against
conflicting evidence in the case, I must carefully assess the evidence before
concluding that guilt has been established.
[221]     
Demeanour evidence alone cannot suffice to make
a finding of guilt.
[222]     
To the extent a credibility or reliability
assessment demands a search for confirmatory evidence for the testimony of a
witness, such evidence need not directly confirm the witness’s evidence in
every respect – the evidence should, however, be capable of restoring the
trier’s faith in the witness’s account.
[223]     
To make my decision on the issues of credibility
and reliability overall, I must consider carefully, and with an open mind, all
the evidence presented during the trial. It will be up to me to decide how much
or little I believe and rely upon the testimony of any witness. I may believe
some, none, or all of it.
[224]     
I must and will use my common sense in deciding
whether people know what they are talking about and whether they are telling
the truth. There is no magic formula for deciding how much or how little of a
witness’s testimony to believe or how much to rely on it in deciding this case.
[225]     
Mr. Sidhu testified through sworn Punjabi
interpreters. I listened carefully to what he had to say and how he said it.
[226]     
Much of his evidence of the issue of knowledge
gave me great concern.
[227]     
At the time of his testimony, Mr. Sidhu was 35 years
old. At the time of his arrest, he was 32 years old.
[228]     
Mr. Sidhu is a citizen of India and a permanent
resident of Canada.
[229]     
The evidence of Mr. Sidhu was marked by his
version of the events. I start by noting that he stated that because of
language issues with English, he had no dealings with the officers on entry to
the United States or on the return to Canada. He also had no dealings with the individuals
at the two places where the outbound shipments were delivered, or the individuals
at the three locations where the four inbound shipments were loaded.
[230]     
I will start my analysis of the Crown’s case
against Mr. Sidhu by noting that in a number of critical respects, I was
troubled by the inconsistencies and illogical suggestions made by Mr. Sidhu in
his testimony.
[231]      
In summary of Mr. Sidhu’s evidence, his duties
on the trip consisted of him:
[232]     
He might have fueled up the tractor and/or
reefer trailer motor at the various Love Stations en route. That is it.
[233]      
It is undisputed that Mr. Singh’s duties
consisted of the following:
[234]      
If Mr. Sidhu’s evidence is accepted, Mr. Singh
would have also been responsible for the following duties:
[235]      
I find this seismically imbalanced work balance
to be unlikely.
[236]      
Mr. Sidhu’s evidence regarding the timing and
use of the seal on the trailer is, quite frankly, absurd and I reject same. On
the one hand, he claimed there was a valid reason to leave the load unsealed,
being so that he and/or Mr. Singh could enter the trailer while en route if
needed if the load had shifted.
[237]      
That is, he and Mr. Singh made a rational
decision not to seal the trailer once the final shipment was loaded in
Woodlake, California. This was done so they could check the load on the return
trip and move the pallets and/or cartons, if necessary, to avoid freight being
damaged by shifting. That was done because they could be docked pay for damaged
product if the pallets shifted en route Mr. Sidhu testified this had happened
to him before.
[238]      
I do not accept this explanation.
[239]      
Firstly, by leaving the trailer unsealed while
driving from Central California to Michigan, he and Mr. Singh were leaving
their trailer vulnerable to easy entry by a third party. This could have
resulted in a relatively unobstructed possibility of a theft of product, or the
placement of illegal items (such as cocaine) in the trailer.
[240]      
In his testimony, he stated that he and Mr.
Singh whenever they stopped and were away from the trailer, the trailer was
always locked. Other than when they showered or used the washroom, they were
together. However, by not placing a seal on the trailer, they left the trailer
vulnerable throughout the trip to Canada. That is illogical and I do not accept
it.
[241]      
I find it incomprehensible that the two drivers
would have exposed themselves to such risks for the sole purpose of ensuring
they could enter the trailer without having to break a seal to adjust the loads
in the event of shifting. The risks associated by having product easily stolen
or third parties placing contraband on the trailer without having to even break
the seal far outweighs the risks of shifting associated with having pallets
loaded with heavy citrus product. This decision is not only irrational, it is
with respect, unbelievable.
[242]      
The implausibility of the explanation for why
the trailer was not sealed is compounded by these additional factors:
[243]      
In fact, Mr. Sidhu amazingly testified that he
was not concerned about that possibility because it was only a “short drive”.
That suggestion, is, with respect, absurd and I reject same.
[244]      
This inattention to the strapping was repeated
after shipments #2 and #3 were loaded and they travelled to Woodlake,
California.
[245]      
Again, I make similar observations regarding the
risk of shifting on the drive from Porterville, California to Woodlake,
California.
[246]      
Furthermore, on Mr. Sidhu’s testimony, he took
no steps to strap the load or ensure it had been properly strapped by Mr. Singh
at any time through to the inspection of the trailer by CBSA officers in
Windsor, Ontario.
[247]      
In summary, I completely reject Mr. Sidhu’s
evidence that they left the trailer unsealed to make entry to the trailer
easier and protect against the calamity of some product being damaged during
the trip without taking a single prudent step to watch the trailer loaded at
any stop or strapping the load, or overseeing the pallets being strapped at
each location. That evidence is in direct contradiction to his stated reason
for not sealing the trailer. I reject it outright.
[248]      
Not only does that explanation run counter to
his concern of being able to respond to the load shifting, but it also defies
logic to suggest that as a driver, he would be travelling over the road without
ensuring that the load was secured.
[249]      
I find it incomprehensible that for someone who
expressed such hyper-sensibility to the financial fallout of the load shifting,
Mr. Sidhu acted irresponsibly and negligently by not doing the things that
would secure the load and prevent damage or theft occurring.
[250]      
It is a non-sensical suggestion. However, it was
necessary for Mr. Sidhu to distance himself from being at or near the trailer
that was discovered holding a box of cocaine containing his fingerprint.
[251]      
I reject the evidence of Mr. Sidhu regarding the
Recochem box containing his fingerprint on the tape affixed to the bottom.
[252]      
I do not accept that he would have been aware
with any specificity that this otherwise anonymous box was being used as a
garbage box in the trailer.
[253]      
Even on his own evidence, he was using the box
to hold garbage being accumulated in the tractor. As it was being used to hold
empty cups, small bottles, and wrappers, there would be no logical reason to
fortify the bottom of the box for the type of refuse that was purportedly being
placed in the box. That someone might want to fortify such a box is
non-sensical.
[254]      
Furthermore, there was no intrinsic value in
using that particular box to use as a garbage container. If the box was so
unstable it could not hold small, light pieces of garbage, it could have been
easily replaced. It is illogical to suggest that the box needed to be fortified
for that purpose.
[255]      
On the other hand, that someone might want to fortify
such a box to hold packages of cocaine, is, on the other hand, plausible.
[256]      
I reject his evidence that someone other than
him must have removed the box and used it to place kilos of cocaine in same. This
would have had to occur from around the time Shipment #3 was being loaded at
Porterville. In his own testimony, only he or Mr. Singh had access to the
tractor because they were either both in the tractor, or together when stopped
with the tractor locked, with one significant exception.
[257]      
That exception is explained on the
cross-examination of Mr. Sidhu by Mr. Marley, counsel for Mr. Singh.
[258]      
I note the following exchange occurred with
respect to the general topic of the differences between the ability of the two
accused individuals to speak English:
[259]      
This evidence
is significant because it establishes that by Mr. Sidhu’s admission:
[260]      
On his own testimony, he was in the tractor or
near the tractor or trailer during the times it was being loaded.
[261]      
I reject the suggestion that someone other than
Mr. Sidhu replaced any garbage in the box and then loaded the cocaine in that
box and then placed it in the trailer at the rear of pallet #6. I also reject
the suggestion by Mr. Sidhu that the same person than went to the trouble of
finding another box, placing a plastic bag inside same and placing it unnoticed
to Mr. Sidhu in the tractor.
[262]      
There would be absolutely no reason for anyone
to have taken Exhibit 3 from the tractor and use it surreptitiously to load it
with cocaine and then, incredibly, locate another box to use as a substitute
garbage box in the tractor complete with a plastic bag inside the box. There would
have been no reason for that to occur. That is, nothing would be achieved by
leaving the tractor without a garbage box. Nothing.
[263]      
Furthermore, there was no reason to conceal the
removal of the Recochem box from the tractor in any event.
[264]     
In sum, and taking all of the evidence in this
matter into account:
[265]      
That is on a W.(D.) Step 1 analysis, I do
not believe the evidence of the accused on all of these material points. Step 1
does not satisfy me that since I believe the accused, I must acquit.
[266]      
I also do not accept that Step 2 of W.(D.)
has application. That is, I am not left in the situation where even though I do
not believe the evidence of the accused I am still left with a reasonable
doubt.
[267]      
However, that is not the end of the analysis. A
rejection of the evidence of Mr. Sidhu does not automatically result in a
conviction or proof of the Crown’s case. To do so would reverse the onus
of proof. The onus remains on the Crown to satisfy the court pursuant to
W.(D.) Step #3 and establish that the evidence supports a finding of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
[268]      
Even if I do not believe Mr. Sidhu’s evidence
and am not left in a reasonable doubt by his evidence, then I must consider
whether, on the basis of all of the evidence which I do accept, I am convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt of all of the essential elements of the crimes
charged, including knowledge. Only then can I convict Mr. Sidhu. It is a very
high burden indeed.
[269]      
I must start by asking, if, on the totality of
the evidence, am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sidhu had
knowledge that the cocaine was in the trailer?
[270]      
Given the principle referenced in Villaroman,
the question is more specifically posited as whether the Crown has proven on
the totality of the evidence which the court accepts, that the only reasonable
conclusion available is that Mr. Sidhu knew the boxes of cocaine were in the
trailer?
[271]     
The issue to be resolved is knowledge. I will now
review the evidence, including the lack of evidence, to determine what
reasonable inferences may be drawn.
[272]     
It is noted that 31 bricks of cocaine
collectively weighing almost 31 kilograms were found in three boxes in a
trailer being hauled by Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Singh when it crossed the border into
Canada. Mr. Singh was the driver of the truck when it crossed the border. At
that time, Mr. Singh was exclusively in control of the truck, the trailer, and
the contents of the trailer including the cocaine. Mr. Sidhu was a passenger.
[273]     
The accused were transporting a
multi-million-dollar load of cocaine. The cocaine was in three boxes placed at
the back of a pallet of citrus fruit located about 1/3 of the way into the
trailer from the back.
[274]     
The method of loading each of the 19 pallets of
citrus fruit is significant to a determination of this case. Given the size of
the pallets, no more than two pallets could be loaded side by side.
[275]     
As depictured in the photographs in Exhibit 1,
when two pallets were loaded side-by-side there was only a few inches between
the boxes of citrus fruit and the wall of the trailer.
[276]     
The first pallets loaded (#17-19) (Shipment #1)
were located at the head of the refrigerated trailer, closest to the tractor
when the trailer is hooked up.
[277]     
When the CBSA officers examined the trailer on
March 17, 2020, they identified each pallet with a number starting at the rear
of the trailer with the last pallets loaded. The numbering also went from left
to right. Accordingly, pallet #1 was at the left rear of the trailer and pallet
#2 was located at the right rear of the trailer. The numbering from the rear of
the trailer went as follows to the row containing the boxes of cocaine:
[278]     
The three boxes containing the cocaine were placed
on the back of pallet #6. There were no loose citrus fruit cartons in the
trailer.
[279]     
CBSA photographs at Exhibits1-3 and 1-5 show the
boxes containing the cocaine on top of pallet #6. However, the boxes of the
cocaine were found on the back of the pallet, not on top. The officer moved the
boxes before taking the photograph. That pallet was located on the left in the
4th row from the rear doors of the trailer. The only pallets located closer to
the rear of the trailer on inspection were pallets #1-#5. They were all part of
shipment #4 and were loaded at Woodlake, California.
[280]     
I start by assessing what is known about the
loading of the trailer of four shipments at three locations.
[281]     
I have concluded that the earliest the three
boxes of cocaine could have been placed at the back of the less than full pallet
#6 was as or after that pallet was loaded onto the trailer with shipment #3.
[282]     
That shipment #3 was comprised of pallets 6, 7,
8, 9 and 10. Pallets 8, 9 and 10 were situated behind pallets 6 and 7. It is obvious
that the boxes of cocaine could not have been placed on pallet 6 until it was
loaded.
[283]     
The Bill of Lading for shipment #3 (Ex. 1-27)
provides that there were ten cartons missing from shipment #3. It is clear from
the photographs that of the five pallets that comprised shipment #3, only pallet
#6 is less than full.
[284]     
On the evidence of Mr. Sidhu, at no time while
shipment #2 (pallets 11-16) and shipment #3 (pallets 6-10) were being loaded at
Porterville was the tractor left unoccupied and unlocked.
[285]     
For Mr. Sidhu’s innocent explanation regarding
his fingerprint to be accepted, the court would have to make the following
findings of fact:
[286]     
That means that only Mr. Sidhu or Mr. Singh
could have taken the Recochem box from the tractor at Porterville.
[287]     
Since Mr. Singh was the person dealing with the
paperwork, for him to have used this box to load cocaine into same and place it
in the trailer, he would have had to do the following:
[288]     
I note parenthetically that not sealing the
trailer would do nothing to secure the load. It only made access to the trailer
easier.
[289]     
Not strapping the load at each point of loading
put the freight at risk of shifting.
[290]     
The most significant evidence in this respect is
photograph Exhibit 1-8. That photo depicts what the rear of the trailer would
have looked like when the two accused departed Porterville. Had the three
cocaine boxes been loaded in Porterville by someone other than Mr. Sidhu or Mr.
Singh, they would have been readily apparent to anyone observing the rear of
the trailer at that time.
[291]     
The obviousness of that conclusion is even more
clear if Mr. Sidhu and/or Mr. Singh or both of them had checked and/or strapped
the front of pallets # 6 and #7.
[292]     
This is where the following evidence of Mr.
Sidhu is relevant as he was clear that:
[293]     
Had anyone else, be it Mr. Singh or a third party,
somehow managed to excrete the Recochem box from the tractor, fill it with
packages of cocaine and place them at the back of pallet #6, Mr. Sidhu would
have easily detected the contraband had he done any of the aforementioned tasks.
[294]     
He denies doing these tasks because if he
admitted that, it places him in a position to either place the boxes of cocaine
himself (or assist someone else) on pallet #6, or notice the cocaine if it had
somehow been placed there by someone else.
[295]     
I have concluded that the reason Mr. Sidhu
testified that he did none of those things was to distance himself, albeit
illogically from the placement of the boxes of cocaine in the trailer and
specifically on pallet #6.
[296]     
As well, from the time shipments #2 and #3 were
loaded in Porterville to the time pallets 4 and 5 from shipment #4 were loaded
in Woodlake, with pallets 6 and 7 closest to the back of the trailer, those two
pallets were easily accessible without impediment.
[297]     
I reject the possibility that someone other than
Mr. Sidhu hid the three boxes of cocaine onto the back of pallet #6 once pallets
1 to 5 were loaded at Woodlake.
[298]     
There is no evidence that the tractor was left
unattended while the two accused were at Woodlake where they picked up shipment
#4.
[299]     
Given that the tractor was never left unattended
at either Porterville (shipments 2 and 3) or Woodlake (shipment 4), it would
not have been possible for a third party to enter the tractor and remove the
Recochem box before loading it with the packages of cocaine and placing the
same with two other boxes at the back of pallet #6.
[300]     
The three boxes of cocaine could only have been
added to the tractor without the requirement to remove or navigate any of the
pallets loaded at Woodlake between the completion of the loading of shipment #3
in Porterville and the commencement of the loading of shipment #4 in Woodlake.
[301]      
It is not a rational explanation to suggest that
if one or more third parties placed the cocaine in the trailer, they would have
brought two loaded Home Depot boxes and other loose packages of cocaine to the
truck. Such a person, or persons, would then have had to find a way to remove
the Recochem box from the tractor without detection by either Mr. Sidhu and/or
Mr. Singh. They would then have had to load the box with cocaine and stash it
on the trailer after load #3 was placed on the truck again without detection.
[302]      
That suggestion is with respect, illogical and I
do not consider it a rational or reasonable inference.  A person or persons in
that situation would have placed (or dropped) the three boxes of cocaine on the
floor of the trailer on either side of Pallet #3 which was alone in the middle
of the trailer.
[303]      
Exhibit 1-8 accurately depicts the inference
that Mr. Sidhu knew the cocaine was in the trailer.  It shows the boxes of cocaine
visible when the loading of Shipment #3 was complete. Had someone placed the
cocaine there it would have been readily detected by either Mr. Sidhu or Mr.
Singh before they departed, examined or strapped the load.
[304]      
All of these factors lead me to conclude that
third party agents did not place the three boxes of cocaine on the trailer
without detection or awareness by either or both accused.
[305]      
As well, it would have been irresponsible and
therefore unlikely that third party agents would secretly place such a valuable
quantity of cocaine onto Pallet #6 to have Mr. Singh and Sidhu act as blind
couriers on the evidence in this case.
[306]      
That unlikelihood is further compounded by the
fact that the window of time to place the three boxes on pallet #6 while in the
process of removing the Recochem box from the tractor was incredibly tight.
[307]      
It is even more unlikely that third party agents
could have placed the boxes of cocaine on the trailer after pallets 1 – 5 were
loaded. That would have required someone to climb the load over pallets #1 and
#2, and beside #3 and over 4 and 5 to place the three heavy boxes on pallet #6.
That would have had to occur without detection by either Mr. Sidhu or Mr.
Singh.
[308]      
Even in the unlikely event that a third party
gained access to the trailer after it was fully loaded, it is highly unlikely
that such those persons would have climbed the load to place the boxes at the
back of Pallet #6 when they could have been better hidden in the space behind
Pallet #3.
[309]     
For all of these reasons, I have concluded that
it was not a rational or reasonable inference on the evidence that for a third
party to have secreted the Recochem box from the tractor after pallet #6 was
loaded and have placed it with the two Home Depot boxes on the trailer.
[310]     
On the totality of the evidence with respect to
Mr. Sidhu, I have concluded that the only rational inference to be drawn from
the evidence is as follows:
[311]     
I conclude, after considering all of the
evidence, including dismissing Mr. Sidhu’s attempts to provide an innocent
explanation for the box with this fingerprint on the tape and containing
cocaine being found in the sealed trailer. that the only reasonable inference
is that Mr. Sidhu had knowledge of the cocaine in the trailer when he crossed
the border into Canada. Therefore, I am convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt,
of the guilt of Mr. Sidhu on both charges.
[312]     
In sum, and for the foregoing reasons, I find Sukhdeep
Singh Sidhu guilty as to Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment.
[313]     
From the outset, there is a significant
difference in the evidence regarding Mr. Singh from Mr. Sidhu.
[314]     
That is, there is an absence of his fingerprint
situated anywhere, including, but not limited to, the Recochem box.
[315]     
The Crown submits that it has still proven its
case against Mr. Singh beyond a reasonable doubt.
[316]     
The Crown starts by asserting that absence of
Mr. Singh’s fingerprint is not in and of itself indicative of an absence of Mr.
Singh’s knowledge.
[317]     
While that statement may be true, it is not
sufficient for the Crown to establish that the only rational inference is that
Mr. Singh had knowledge of the boxes of cocaine in the trailer because of the
other similarities in the evidence.
[318]     
In this respect, the Crown submits that the
three boxes contained 31 kilograms of cocaine. Those items are not “easy to
hide or transfer without being noticed”. Based on this, the Crown submits that
it is unlikely that Mr. Sidhu or Mr. Singh could have accomplished a transfer
of the boxes of cocaine without the other noticing.
[319]      
The Crown submits the case of knowledge can also
be made against Mr. Singh and cited a variety of factors, as follows:
[320]      
Based on all of
this evidence, the Crown submits that the court can infer that the only
reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Singh was also aware that there was cocaine in
the trailer.
[321]      
With respect, I
disagree.
[322]      
I cannot
conclude that the only reasonable conclusion is that they both acted in concert
and the only reasonable inference is that Mr. Singh also knew that there was
cocaine on the trailer a I have concluded with respect to Mr. Sidhu. That is:
[323]      
It is clear on
the evidence that Mr. Singh was the person who dealt with the shippers because
of his superior English skills. That is borne out not only by the testimony of
Mr. Sidhu, but the fact that only Mr. Singh’s signature was on any of the
various shipping papers. Accordingly, it is possible that given Mr. Singh was
away from the truck at the various pick-up points, Mr. Sidhu could have placed
the cocaine on the pallet #6 of the load without the knowledge of Mr. Singh or
otherwise given some to a third party.
[324]      
In this
respect, I return to the cross-examination of Mr. Sidhu by Mr. Marley where he
established the following:
[325]      
To be clear, I
am not saying that this happened. Rather I have simply concluded that on the
totality of the evidence that Mr. Singh acted in conjunction with Mr. Sidhu is
not the only reasonable inference I can make as prescribed in Villoraman.
[326]      
That is the
measure that the Supreme Court of Canada has placed on me as the trier of fact
in a circumstantial case such as this.
[327]      
For that
reason, both charges as against Mr. Singh are dismissed.
[328]      
Mr. Sidhu,
please stand:
[329]      
Mr. Singh,
please stand:
