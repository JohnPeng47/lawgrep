[1]              
The plaintiff brought an action for injuries that
he allegedly sustained in a motor vehicle accident on March 3, 2015.  The trial
was heard by a jury.  The defendant conceded liability.
[2]              
After the jury retired to consider its verdict,
the defendant brought a threshold motion for a declaration that the plaintiff’s
claim for health care expenses and non-pecuniary damages is barred as his injuries
do not fall within the exceptions set out under ss. 267.5(3) and (5) of the Insurance
Act, RSO 1990, c I-8 (the “Act”) and applicable regulations. While the
motion was being argued, the jury returned a verdict that awarded no damages.  I
finished hearing the motion and indicated that I would rule on the motion as
the threshold issue must be decided even if a verdict awarding no damages is delivered:
Mandel v. Fakhim, 2018 ONSC 7580 (Div Ct) at para 33.[1]
[3]              
At the conclusion of trial,
I gave directions for delivering written costs submissions if the parties could
not resolve costs for the action. The parties delivered written submissions on
costs as directed.
[4]              
For the reasons that follow, I am allowing the
defendant’s threshold motion and awarding the defendant $150,000.00 in costs for
the action.
[5]              
While the jury was
deliberating, the defendant brought a co-called “threshold” motion for a finding
that the plaintiff’s claim for health care expenses and non-pecuniary loss is
barred as he failed to establish on the evidence that, as a result of the motor
vehicle accident, he sustained a permanent, serious impairment of an important
physical, mental or psychological function. Only if the plaintiff meets this
threshold would he fall within an exception to the statutory immunity under
ss. 267.5(3) and (5) of the Act and applicable regulations and be able
to recover health care expenses and/or an award of non-pecuniary damages.
[6]              
In deciding the threshold
motion, the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions to consider are set
out in ss. 267.5 of the Act and ss. 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of O.Reg.
461/96 (COURT PROCEEDINGS FOR
AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS THAT OCCUR ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 1, 1996), as
amended by O.Reg. 381/03 (the “Regulation”).
[7]              
Subsections 267.5(3), (5), (12), and (15) of the
Act provide as follows:
[8]              
The Regulation assists in defining
the threshold terminology in s. 267.5 of the Act by defining a
“permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or
psychological function.”  Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of the Regulation
provide as follows:
[9]              
The sub-components of the first and second
criteria under s. 4.2 of the Regulation are disjunctive such that the first two
criteria will be satisfied if any one of the sub-components are established. 
The third of the criteria under s. 4.2 is conjunctive, such that all
sub-components must be satisfied before that criterion will be met.  All three
criteria must be met to meet the threshold test: Sauve v. Steele, 2021
ONSC 4053 at para 32; Mayer v. 1474479 Ontario
Inc., 2013 ONSC 6806 at para 16.
[10]          
Section 4.3 of the
Regulation sets out the expert medical evidence that must be led to show that
the statutory exception or “threshold” has been satisfied.  The provision reads
as follows:
[11]          
Diamond J. in Ayub v. Sun, 2015 ONSC 1828 at paras 13-14 adopted the fulsome summary that Firestone J. (as
he then was) gave in Malfara v. Vukojevic, 2015 ONSC 78 at
para 7 onwards, of the relevant jurisprudence and principles to consider on a
threshold motion, and highlighted this summary as follows:
[12]          
A physician’s evidence of a change in function
requires corroboration under s. 4.3(5) of the Regulation.  Any other person,
including the plaintiff, may corroborate the evidence given by a physician of a
change in function: Gyorffy v. Drury, 2015 ONCA 31 at paras 25 and
36-37; Sanei v. Debarros, 2024 ONCA 104 at para 28.
[13]          
The threshold serves to limit the rights of
motor vehicle accident victims to ongoing health care costs and non-pecuniary
damages in exchange for “more generous first-party benefits, regardless of
fault, from their own insurer”: Meyer v. Bright (1993), 1993 CanLII 3389 (ON CA), 15 OR (3d)
129 (CA), leave to appeal refused sub nom Lento v. Castaldo,
[1993] SCCA No 540.  As Schabas J. aptly noted in Robichaud v. Constantinidis,
2019 ONSC 5995 at para 2, “the limitations, therefore, focus on the
seriousness and permanence of the injury and its importance to the victim in
allowing claims for damages only in more serious cases.”
[14]          
The plaintiff was born on June
22, 1989 and is now 35 years of age.  After separating from his ex-spouse in
October 2023, he re-partnered and now co-parents a son from his former marriage
and a daughter from his current relationship.  Both children are
toddlers.
[15]          
Before the March 3, 2015 accident, the plaintiff reported no physical
or mental health issues.  However, his pre-accident weight at times approached 300
lbs that, according to his family physician, made him overweight given his
height of 5’8”. The plaintiff also suffered depression due to relationship
issues with his girlfriend who became his wife.  He received treatment for a
mood disorder that impacted his post-secondary education.
[16]          
On the afternoon of March 3, 2015, the plaintiff
was involved in a two-vehicle accident in which his vehicle was “t-boned” by a vehicle
that the defendant was driving.  The plaintiff was wearing a seat belt when the
accident occurred.  He did not lose consciousness and did not sustain any head
injury.  His vehicle’s air bags did not deploy, but the vehicle was quite
damaged in the accident.  He was 25 years old at the time.  He reported no
injuries in his statement to police.
[17]          
After the accident, a tow truck driver dropped
him off at the University of Guelph where he was to deliver a group presentation
for a class that he was taking.  After arriving at the campus, the plaintiff
felt his body stiffen to the point where he could not move his neck or
shoulders.  He also developed chest pains.  He called his roommate who drove him
home.  Later that evening, he went to hospital after experiencing dizziness and
nausea.  He saw an emergency physician who made a soft tissue injury diagnosis
and prescribed muscle relaxants and Advil before discharging him.  At trial, the
plaintiff testified that he left hospital with radiating nerve pain along his
left thigh that he later reported in February 2017.  He did not return to
hospital for any accident-related health issues.
[18]          
The plaintiff did not go to university for about
two weeks after the accident.  On March 10, 2015, he attended a walk-in clinic
where a physician referred him to a rehabilitation clinic. On the advice of a
family member, the plaintiff went to a different clinic on March 11, 2015 where
he was assessed by a physiotherapist who set up a biweekly physiotherapy program
for him over several months. After attending about 30 physiotherapy sessions,
the plaintiff had a full range of motion in his neck and back.  On July 7,
2015, he was discharged from physiotherapy with a treatment plan that included
a self-directed home exercise program.  He received massages while vacationing
abroad in 2017.
[19]          
After the March 3, 2015 motor vehicle accident,
the plaintiff first saw his family physician, Dr. Yu, on March 23, 2015 for
neck, shoulder, and back pain, among other things.  As the plaintiff acknowledged,
his back pain did not solely result from the accident.  At trial, he could not
recall whether he ever directly told Dr. Yu that his back pain was due to the
accident, but said that he did not during his examination for discovery.  The
plaintiff told Dr. Yu that he had seen an emergency physician and started physiotherapy.
On examination, Dr. Yu found that Mr. Trieu had a normal range of movement, no
head injury, clear respiration, and pain in his neck, shoulder, arm, chest, and
abdomen that was consistent with accident-related trauma.  Dr. Yu diagnosed Mr.
Trieu with soft tissue injury to the neck, shoulder, and back, and advised him
to continue with physiotherapy as the primary treatment without prescribing
pain medication. Dr. Yu did not prescribe medication as he preferred to treat
the plaintiff with physical therapy to rehab the muscle injuries that were
causing his pain rather than treating the symptoms with analgesics. Dr. Yu
advised the plaintiff that the pain would be alleviated by weight loss and by
building his core muscles with exercise. During the visit, Dr. Yu charted the
plaintiff with having “no radiation of pain.”
[20]          
The plaintiff next saw Dr. Yu on February 1,
2017 when he first complained of lower back pain radiating to his posterior
thigh that was said to persist about 70% of the time with restricted back
movement.  By this time, the plaintiff had been in three (3) other motor
vehicle accidents.  Dr. Yu testified that the radiating pain may have resulted
from something other than the March 3, 2015 motor vehicle accident, including
the other three accidents and the plaintiff’s weight. The plaintiff reported
that he had exhausted his physiotherapy coverage but the defendant led evidence
to show that further physiotherapy treatment benefits were available to him. Dr.
Yu recommended local heat therapy (i.e., via a heating pad) and back-stretching
exercises to address the pain.
[21]          
Dr. Yu next saw the plaintiff on May 29, 2017
for lower back pain and radiating leg pain.  Mr. Trieu reported not receiving physiotherapy
for 2 or 3 months and feeling that his improvement had plateaued. Dr. Yu
recommended stretching exercises with heat therapy and physiotherapy.
[22]          
Dr. Yu referred the plaintiff to a pain clinic. 
Dr. Esdaile, a physician at the pain clinic, charted that the plaintiff had reported
lower back and left thigh pain. After ordering x-rays that showed mild
degenerative disc disease expected with aging, Dr. Esdaile recommended that the
plaintiff lose weight and perform core strengthening and stretching exercises.
[23]          
In 2018, Dr. Yu did not see the plaintiff.  At
trial, Dr. Yu testified that he had expected the plaintiff to report any
persisting health issue from the March 3, 2015 accident and presumed that any
health issues the plaintiff had did not require medical attention or treatment
from him.
[24]          
Dr. Yu next saw the plaintiff on June 27, 2019 for
a routine physical check up.  During the visit, the plaintiff did not report
any pain or other health issues. Dr. Yu charted that the plaintiff had “no
health issues” and was taking “no medications.”
[25]          
After May 2017 and until January 2021, the
plaintiff did not report any pain to Dr. Yu or advise that he had missed work
due to pain.  On January 4, 2021, Dr. Yu saw the plaintiff who reported anxiety
issues without mentioning the 2015 accident or any pain issues. Thereafter, in
January 2021 and February 2021, Dr. Yu saw Mr. Trieu on multiple occasions for
mental health issues but not for any pain or other issues related to the 2015
accident.  Dr. Yu saw the plaintiff in March, April, June, August, and October
2021. The plaintiff did not raise any pain or accident-related issues during
any of these visits.
[26]          
The following year, Dr. Yu saw the plaintiff for
care in September, October, November, and December 2022.  The plaintiff did not
raise any pain or accident-related issues on these visits.
[27]          
Dr. Yu saw the plaintiff in February, April,
July, August, and December of 2023.  No pain or accident-related issues were
reported on these occasions.
[28]          
Dr. Yu saw the plaintiff in January, March, and
May of 2024.  The plaintiff did not report any pain or other issues related to the
2015 accident on these visits.
[29]          
On July 8, 2024, the plaintiff saw Dr. Yu for a
right upper back strain.  This was the first time that he reported any pain to
Dr. Yu since 2017.
[30]          
At the time of the March 3, 2015 accident, the plaintiff was
residing in Hamilton and attending his final year of a 4-year undergraduate
commerce degree at the University of Guelph.  His graduation from university in
2015 was not impacted by the accident.
[31]          
On January 1, 2016, the plaintiff began to work full-time at a
restaurant operated by his uncle and other family members.  Due to the physical
demands of the position and his accident-related back pain, his uncle
accommodated his work limitations by giving him a managerial role to minimize
his work-related physical activity.  However, during busy periods at the
restaurant, particularly around holidays, and after his uncle suffered a heart
attack in 2016, the plaintiff felt obliged to work through his back pain to
help operate the family restaurant business.
[32]          
Almost two (2) years after the accident, the
plaintiff continued to experience accident-related back pain and purportedly
had anxiety when driving through intersections.  As a result, he commenced this
action on February 16, 2017.
[33]          
In 2017, the plaintiff started up a children’s
party equipment rental business.  During engagements, he would deliver, set up,
and distribute battery-operated ride-on cars for children to play with and use. 
The venture was modestly profitable.
[34]          
On January 27, 2018, the plaintiff married.  He
testified that his accident-related back pain impacted his marriage by limiting
activities with his wife, their ability to be intimate, his ability to perform
household chores, and his ability to care for their infant son, among other
things.  After separating from his wife on October 16, 2023 and re-partnering, he
claims that his accident-related pain has impacted his new relationship by
limiting his ability to engage in similar activities.
[35]          
In June 2018, the plaintiff settled his claim
for statutory accident benefits for $1,500.00 in further medical benefits. He received
about $4,500.00 in medical or rehabilitation benefits from his accident
benefits carrier on account of the March 3, 2015 accident.
[36]          
The plaintiff has been and is able to
independently perform all of his personal care tasks.
[37]          
In 2019, the plaintiff vacationed in Japan for
three weeks, played laser tag at a rented indoor venue with friends on his
birthday, and started up a high-end auto-detailing business for which he
personally washed, paint-corrected and detailed the exterior of vehicles with ceramic
coatings.
[38]          
In 2020, the plaintiff started an online retail business. 
His online sales grew significantly in 2022 and 2023 after the business began
to market a popular and lucrative Faraday key-shield box for keyless-entry car
fobs to prevent car thefts.
[39]          
In 2021, the plaintiff was diagnosed with Graves’
disease (i.e., a hypothyroidism condition) and diabetes, along with ADHD and
OCD issues.  In addition, he had career and relationship issues that impacted his
health at times.  None of these issues are related to the March 3, 2015
accident.
[40]          
Based on all of the evidence led at trial, I
find that the plaintiff does not meet the statutory exception, or threshold, for
recovering health care costs or non-pecuniary damages.  I accept that he was injured
in the March 3, 2015 accident.  However, I find that his accident-related injury
did not cause a permanent or long-lasting serious impairment to satisfy the
criteria under s. 4.2 of the Regulation.[3]
Although the accident caused him pain for a period of time, I find that his accident-related
soft-tissue injury had resolved by July 7, 2015 when he was discharged from
physiotherapy.
[41]          
Dr. Max Kleinman, the plaintiff’s physiatry
expert, testified that the plaintiff has mild to moderate mechanical back pain and
myofascial sprain and strain from the March 3, 2015 accident that reached
maximum medical improvement and will not resolve over time. Dr. Kleinman opined
that the back pain is chronic and advised the plaintiff to avoid activities
that will increase his pain by using pacing strategies (i.e., to avoid
prolonged sitting and standing), by changing his posture frequently, and by not
lifting heavy items that will aggravate his pain.  Dr. Kleinman testified that
physiotherapy and chiropractic care are reasonable forms of therapy to address
flare ups with the chronic back pain condition.
[42]          
Dr. Raymond Zabieliauskas, the defence expert
physiatrist, disagreed with Dr. Kleinman’s opinion.  Dr. Zabieliauskas agreed that
the plaintiff had strained some muscles in the March 3, 2015 accident. However,
he noted that an emergency physician saw the plaintiff that same evening, found
a full range of motion with no muscle spasm, had no apparent reason to order
x-rays or prescribe any medication, and had recommended physiotherapy. On July
7, 2015, the plaintiff was discharged from physiotherapy with a self-directed
exercise plan (i.e., mirroring the treatment plan that Dr. Esdaile proposed in
2017). In light of this, Dr. Zabieliauskas opined that the plaintiff had made a
full physical recovery by the July 7, 2015 discharge date.  The fact that the
plaintiff had discontinued physiotherapy and did not see his family physician for
two years further supported Dr. Zabieliauskas’ view that the plaintiff made a
good recovery from his accident-related injury.
[43]          
I accept that the plaintiff is experiencing back
pain of some permanence that involves a weakened condition lasting into the
indefinite future without a definite end: Brak at para 4; Bishop-Gittens
v. Lim, 2016 ONSC 2887 at para 67.  I find that his symptoms have been
continuous since the 2015 accident that is a cause, albeit not necessarily the
sole cause, of his impairment: Clements v. Clements, 2012 SCC 32 at para
8; Castro v. Chen, 2024 ONSC 6584 at para 83.  Despite the intermittent
nature of his impairment that waxed and waned over time and was not unrelenting, 
I accept that his health condition satisfies the permanent impairment
requirement: Noori v. Liu, 2020 ONSC 3049 at para 101; Castro at para 84. 
However, as discussed below, I am not persuaded that the plaintiff has established
an important or serious impairment to satisfy the threshold test.
[44]          
The plaintiff claims to now suffer chronic back
pain that continues to impact him.  He gave evidence that the pain improved
over time but plateaued and continues to persist.  He testified that the pain
has not fully resolved, is aggravated by some activities, and affects his
ability to work and engage in daily activities, including those with his partner
and children. He claims to be incapable of doing certain work, family, and
recreational activities including anything involving repetitive movements,
bending, prolonged sitting or standing without pacing, and lifting heavy
objects repeatedly. He claims to have good days with tolerable pain, and bad days
with debilitating pain.
[45]          
The defendant disagrees with the plaintiff’s description
of his back pain and submits that he has embellished or exaggerated the nature
and extent of the discomfort, if any, with his back.  The defence challenged
the plaintiff’s description of the pain in cross-examination by playing
surveillance footage, YouTube videos, and other social media content that
depicts him engaged in various physical tasks or activities including auto
detailing work, performing lawncare, moving household items, carrying his son,
pantomiming in a Halloween costume, and carrying up to three cases of soda at
one time. In addition, the plaintiff acknowledged that he renovated his garage
for his auto detailing business and relocated a collection of steel shelves in the
garage to a different part of his residential property to make room for his
detailing work.
[46]          
I find that the plaintiff’s impairment does not
substantially interfere with an important aspect of his life: Meyer at
para 25. After a two week period, the plaintiff resumed his university studies,
graduated in 2015 as planned, worked at the family restaurant after graduation,
and went on to pursue several entrepreneurial business opportunities in the
years that followed.  Taking everything into account, I find that the degree of
impairment to the plaintiff and his daily life did not go beyond a tolerable
level with therapy and pacing: Frankfurter v. Gibbons, 2004 CanLII 45880
(Div Ct) at paras 22-24.
[47]          
In my view, the plaintiff’s impairment has not
substantially interfered with his work or life to the extent necessary to
establish a serious impairment.  The term “serious” does not mean “very
serious” or catastrophic: Meyer at para 29; Robichaud at para
22.  As the word “serious” is used in s. 267.5 of the Act, “it
is apparent the legislature intended that injured persons are required to bear
some detrimental impact upon their life without being able to sue for it”: Meyer
at para 70. That said, a person who carries on with their daily activities
while subject to permanent symptoms including sleep disorder, severe neck pain,
headaches, dizziness, and nausea that significantly impacts their enjoyment of
life must be considered to suffer a serious impairment: May v Casola, [1998]
OJ No 2475 (CA) at para 1; Robichaud at para 23; Persaud v. Bascom, 2021
ONSC 4398 at para 33; Fraser v. Persaud, 2023 ONSC 1449 at paras
498-504.  An impairment can be “serious” where
the plaintiff is able to resume employment through his own determination but
continues to experience pain: Brak v Walsh, 2008 ONCA
221 at para 7;
[48]          
Taking everything into account, I find that the
plaintiff’s accident-related impairment does not rise to the level of
seriousness that would meet the threshold test on this motion.  He has been
able to independently perform most if not all tasks of daily living with pacing
and the occasional use of over-the-counter Tylenol and marijuana.  He performed
work and entrepreneurial activities with accommodations or self-accommodations as
required. I find on balance that his impairment does not substantially
interfere with his work or life to satisfy the threshold test on this motion. Similar
impairments involving claimants with soft-tissue injuries in other motor
vehicle accident cases were not found to be “serious” impairments: Meyer
at paras 90-96; Valentine v. Rodriguez-Elizalde, 2016 ONSC 3540 at paras
82-86; Robichaud at paras 24-27.
[49]          
There were conflicting expert opinions about the
plaintiff’s injury.  For the most part, the medical witnesses relied on the
plaintiff’s self-reports.  Given its verdict, the jury did not accept his evidence
about the nature and extent of his injury from the March 3, 2015 accident.
[50]          
 Accordingly, I find
that the plaintiff has failed to establish that this case falls within the
exception to the statutory immunity under s. 267.5(5) of the Act
and s. 4.1(1) of the Regulation.
[51]          
This motor vehicle action
proceeded to a jury trial that began on November 12, 2024 and was heard over
twelve days. The jury’s verdict awarded no damages. The defendant was entirely
successful in the action and is presumptively entitled to costs.
[52]          
The court has broad
discretion in deciding costs: ss. 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act,
RSO 1990, c C.43.  Rule 57.01 provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the
court to consider in awarding costs. The overall objective is to determine an
amount that is fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful party to pay, and not
an amount based on actual costs incurred by the successful party: Boucher
v. Public Accountants Counsel for Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71
OR (3d) 291 (CA).  The court should also consider the principle of
proportionality under Rule 1.04(1.1) and seek to balance the indemnity
principle with the fundamental objective of access to justice.
[53]          
The plaintiff claimed $1 million in damages. The
defendant admitted liability for the accident that shortened the trial.   In my
view, the action was moderately complex.
[54]          
The plaintiff brought a pre-trial motion to
strike the jury notice that led to a mixed result and an award of $1,500.00 in
costs in the event of the cause.[4] 
Despite this, the defendant’s bill of costs appears to claim $6,006.00 in costs
for the motion.  Having regard to the award of costs for the motion, the
defendant shall have costs of $1,500.00 for the motion.
[55]          
The “nil” judgment for the
trial places the plaintiff in the same position as if the action was dismissed: Dermann
v. Baker, 2019 ONCA 584 at para 25.
[56]          
 The defendant
achieved a result that was as favourable as the terms of his offer to settle. 
This favours the defendant’s position that elevated costs may be appropriate, even
though there is no entitlement under Rule 49.10 to a higher award of costs.  As
the plaintiff did not recover any judgment, Rule 49.10 does not apply: Dermann at para 24; S&A Strasser Ltd v.
Richmond Hill (Town) (1990), 1990 CanLII 6856 (ON CA), 1 OR (3d)
243 (CA) at 245.  I shall, however, exercise my discretion by taking into
account the parties’ written offers to settle pursuant to Rule 49.13.
[57]          
The parties completed examinations for discovery
on October 12, 2017. Afterwards, on or about November 17, 2017, the defendant
served an offer to settle for a dismissal of the action without costs.  The
offer expired on December 18, 2017.
[58]          
On or about July 9, 2019, after incurring further
costs, the defendant served a non-severable offer to settle for a dismissal of
the action and $1,500.00 in costs payable to the defendant.  This offer expired
on August 1, 2019.
[59]          
On or about January 14, 2021, the plaintiff
served an offer to settle for $5,000.00 in general damages, $5,000.00 for past
and future wage loss and future care costs, $1,174.25 in pre-judgment interest,
plus his partial indemnity costs and disbursements.  The offer to settle
remained open for acceptance until after the commencement of trial.
[60]          
On or about January 26, 2021, and then on or
about February 13, 2024, the defendant served non-severable offers to settle for
a dismissal of the action without costs that remained open for acceptance until
April 1, 2021 and April 1, 2024, respectively. If not accepted by those dates, each
offer to settle was reduced to an offer for a dismissal of the action with partial
indemnity costs payable to the defendant up until the acceptance date.  Both offers
remained open until after the commencement of trial.
[61]          
Given the result in this
case, the defendant’s offers to settle were reasonable by correctly predicting
the outcome of the litigation.  The defendant was entitled to put the plaintiff
to the proof, and his offers to settle the action on a without costs basis reflected
a true element of compromise: Mundinger v. Ashton,
2020 ONSC 2024 at para 20, citing Foulis
et al. v. Robinson; Gore Mutual Ins. Co., Third Party, 1978 CanLII
1307 (ONCA).
[62]          
I shall exercise my discretion to disregard the
defendant’s written costs submissions about an exchange between counsel on
November 15, 2024 during trial.  As the plaintiff was under cross-examination
at that time, his counsel appropriately indicated to defendant’s counsel that
he could not obtain any settlement instructions.  It follows that this exchange
by counsel could not give rise to any offer to settle.  In the circumstances, I
find that this exchange is not relevant to my decision on costs.
[63]          
I find that the defendant’s conduct resulted in
a 1½-day voir dire due to a last-minute filing (i.e., for the purpose of
adducing certain online videos and posts at trial) that did not comply with the
notice requirements under ss. 35(3) of the Evidence Act, RSO 1990, c E.23.
Compliance with the requirements under s. 35(3) would have avoided the voir
dire and shortened the trial.
[64]          
The defendant unsuccessfully objected to Ms.
Hawley being qualified as an income loss expert for the plaintiff at trial. 
The objection resulted in a voir dire of about a half-day.
[65]          
In my view, the availability of legal expense
insurance in this case is not a relevant factor to consider in deciding costs. Both
parties made submissions about the implications of the legal expense insurance available
to plaintiff’s counsel under a policy that his law firm has purchased.  I am
advised that specific terms in the policy clearly stipulate that the policy is
not to be shared with a non-party, such as the defendant or his insurer. In
keeping with this, plaintiff’s counsel did not disclose the policy to the defence. 
I note this for the limited purpose of refuting the defendant’s submission that
the plaintiff acted unreasonably by not disclosing the policy.  Given the terms
of the policy as plaintiff’s counsel represented as an officer of the court, I
accept that his refusal to disclose the policy to the defence was not unreasonable.
In any event, the existence and amount of coverage under the legal expense
policy is not relevant in awarding costs: Canfield
v. Brockville Ontario Speedway, 2018
ONSC 3288 at para 59; Mundinger at para 16.
[66]          
The defendant cited a number
of cases in which the court awarded costs to the successful defendant ranging from
$111,614.65 to $189,298.68 (i.e., that at the high range is said to approach $222,429.00
in 2024 dollars after adjustments for inflation) in somewhat similar
circumstances: Osmani at para 108; Mundinger at para 21; Nguyen
v. Szot, 2017 ONSC 3705 at para 48; Loye v. Bowers, 2020 ONSC 782 at
para 48. I have considered these cases in determining what an unsuccessful
plaintiff could or should reasonably expect to pay in costs after a similar jury
trial.
[67]          
The plaintiff submits that he should not be
liable for the cost of having the defendant’s co-counsel attend the trial,
particularly as senior counsel for the defendant led for the entire trial
except on the threshold motion that he could have argued.  However, the
plaintiff also had co-counsel to assist senior counsel throughout this 2½ week trial
in which multiple witnesses testified and various procedural and evidentiary
issues were raised. Given the nature of the trial, I accept that it was reasonable
for both sides to have co-counsel to progress the litigation appropriately.
[68]          
I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the
defendant’s bill of costs (i.e., that aggregates the time claimed and is more in
the nature of a costs outline) does not permit a fulsome assessment of the time
claimed for duplication or reasonableness by omitting contemporaneous docket
entries.  As the bill of costs lists eight (8) lawyers and ten (10) law clerks who
worked on the file, I have some concern over the potential for inefficiencies or
duplication when those new to the file were introduced to the matter.  However,
I also accept that work likely was delegated to minimize costs.
[69]          
I find that the hourly rates claimed by the
defendant seem fair and reasonable.  In my view, the time claimed by the defendant
for pleadings, document production, examinations for discovery, offers to
settle, and conferences is largely just and proportional. As previously stated,
the defendant shall have his costs for the motion to strike the jury notice fixed
at $1,500.00 all-inclusively.
[70]          
The plaintiff submits that the defendant’s claim
for trial time is excessive.  However, I do not find that the trial time
claimed by the defendant’s senior counsel, co-counsel, and paralegals is overly
excessive given the moderate complexity of the action that each side vigorously
contested over 12 days of trial.  I find that an offset for the defence’s unreasonable
late filing and unsuccessful challenge to the plaintiff’s income loss expert
is appropriate in this particular case.
[71]          
Given the importance of Dr. Zabielauskas’ expert
physiatry evidence at trial, I find that the defendant’s disbursements claim for
his expert reports, prep-calls, and attendance in court (i.e., totalling $29,704.50)
is largely fair and reasonable. I find that the defendant’s disbursements for
trial transcripts and photocopying are reasonable and I shall allow them. I shall
be disallowing the defendant’s claim for a $1,582.00 prep-call with Marcus &
Associates as they did not produce a report or testify, making this a disbursement
that I find should not be borne by the plaintiff.
[72]          
I shall exercise my discretion to not award
costs to the defendant for preparing written costs submissions in this matter.
[73]          
 Taking everything into account, I find that the
defendant should have his partial indemnity costs fixed in the amount of
$150,000.00, inclusive of taxes and disbursements.  In my view, this is a just
and proportional award of costs having regard to the plaintiff’s reasonable
expectations and all of the factors as discussed above.
[74]          
Based on all of the foregoing, I make the
following orders:
