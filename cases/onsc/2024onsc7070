The parties
married on November 10, 2016.  The date of separation appears to be disputed. 
They have three children.  The mother has made serious allegations of abuse.
[2]              
On March 7,
2023, Justice Sharma made a temporary order granting the mother sole parenting
time with and sole decision-making for the three children.
[3]              
On February 9,
2024, Justice Shin Doi ordered the Respondent father to pay interim child
support of $400 a month.  There is no evidence that he has done so.  The
Applicant mother deposes that he is also in breach of disclosure orders.

At a settlement
conference on November 4, 2024, Justice Hood noted that the Respondent did not
appear.  Justice Hood scheduled a one-hour motion today for the mother  to seek
“a parenting order and various orders to allow her to travel with the
children.”  Justice Hood also set a trial management conference for March 28,
2025.

The Applicant
mother sought the following relief:
[6]              
The mother
filed an affidavit but no factum.  The father, who did appear today, did not file
any materials.  He did not dispute receiving notice of today’s motion.
[7]              
Not all of the mother’s
requested relief is contemplated by the Hood J. endorsement.  She agreed to
abandon the requests for a final parenting order, restraining order, order to
strike and order regarding prior orders.
[8]              
While the
father could not make formal submissions given that he filed no materials, I
heard from him that he does not object to the current parenting and
decision-making arrangements provided he does not have to pay costs for today.
[9]              
The father did
not offer any information relevant to the children’s best interests that would contest
the mother’s requests for travel.  I do not find his suggested bargain
regarding costs a relevant factor.
[10]          
The Applicant
seeks $1000 costs for today’s appearance.  The Respondent appeared but did not
file materials.  However, the Applicant included in her motion several heads of
relief that were outside the scope of the leave granted by Justice Hood. She
did not support those requests with a written legal argument.  In the
circumstances, I find that $750 is appropriate.
[11]          
In conclusion,
I make the following order:
