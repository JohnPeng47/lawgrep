This case revolves around a family that
immigrated to Canada from Pakistan in 1997. The couple, who were married for 28
years, have five children. Three of the children are currently living
independently, while two have special needs, with one being unable to live
independently. This was a three-day trial, focusing on the wife's claims for
retroactive child support, ongoing child support, spousal support, property
division, and the jointly-owned matrimonial home.
[2]              
Before the trial, the couple had resolved their
parenting issues. In June 2024, the husband, Muhammed Ahktar Agha, traveled to
Pakistan and has not returned to Canada. He testified via Zoom during the
trial, that he had no intention of returning to live in Canada.
[3]              
At the start of the trial, Zohra Fatima, the
wife, filed a motion to strike the husband's pleadings due to his failure to
comply with previous court orders. Specifically, he had not submitted a current
sworn financial statement or provided necessary disclosure or documents before
the trial. He was also in violation of an interim child support order and
several cost orders. However, the motion was dismissed, allowing the husband to
provide viva voce testimony regarding his finances, as crucial
information was missing from the record. The court aimed to gather sufficient
evidence to address the wife’s claims, particularly regarding his financial
circumstances, even though he had not fully adhered to procedural requirements
under the Family Law Rules, O. Reg. 114/99 (“FLRs”) and the Trial
Scheduling Endorsement Form,.
[4]              
The husband also brought a motion at the commencement of trial
seeking that a) I be recused as the trial judge; b) the wife’s motion to strike
his pleadings be dismissed; and c) the order of Sanfilippo, J., dated November
24, 2022, which had been issued and entered on November 22, 2024 be vacated. I dismissed the husband's motion and provided oral reasons for this
decision and, as a result, I did not step down from the case, the wife's motion
to strike the husband's pleadings was dismissed, and the order from Justice
Sanfilippo remained in place.
[5]              
The issues to be decided at this trial
are as follows:
[6]              
I have found that the outstanding claims the wife has against the
husband shall be satisfied by him vesting his half-interest in the matrimonial
home to the wife, for the reasons set out below.
[7]              
The parties were married on October 25, 1991 in Karachi,
Pakistan in an Islamic religious traditional marriage ceremony. This was a
second marriage for the husband and a first marriage for the wife.
[8]              
The husband is highly educated, with a bachelor’s
degree in electrical engineering which he obtained in Pakistan. Before coming
to Canada, the husband worked for Pakistan Telecom as an electrical engineer.
[9]              
The parties have five children of their marriage. In May
of 1997, the parties immigrated to Canada, at which time they had three
daughters, ages 4, 3 and 8 months old.
[10]          
The wife testified that during their marriage, she
endured multiple forced pregnancies and abortions without her consent. The
couple's three oldest children were born in Pakistan, while their two youngest
children were born in Canada. The family's decision to immigrate to Canada was
largely driven by the need for better medical support for their child, NA, who
had developmental delays and was later diagnosed with a genetic condition.
[11]          
The parties two oldest children have been independent since separation.
The child, RA is now independent since she graduated in June 2024. This trial
involves the wife’s child support claim for the three
younger children. The details about these three children’s circumstances is as
follows:
[12]          
While in Canada, the husband obtained a post-graduate diploma
in wireless communication from Humber College and completed additional
professional certifications from Cisco.
[13]          
It was agreed that during the marriage, the husband was
the primary breadwinner while the wife took care of the household and children.
The husband had a career in the telecommunications industry, working for
several companies over the years, including:
[14]          
The wife testified that their marriage was marked by
family violence, which was perpetrated by the husband. Their child, RA, also
testified, stating that she witnessed the husband engage in both physical and
psychological violence toward the wife during the marriage. Both the wife and
RA further testified that the children were exposed to family violence
throughout the marriage. In contrast, the husband denied any instances of
family violence, instead blaming the wife for alienating the children against him.
[15]          
The parties jointly-own the
matrimonial home, located at 970 Dixon Road, Unit 910. Since the separation,
the wife and children resided in the parties’ jointly-owned matrimonial home,
pursuant to an interim exclusive possession order.
[16]          
Between 2006 and 2010, the husband faced significant
challenges. He started an importing/exporting business called Impex Canada,
which specialized in home and office furniture, but it was unsuccessful. During
this period, the husband began showing signs of mental illness, lost his
long-standing job at Allstream (where he had worked since 1999), and was on
Ontario Works in 2007-2008. Additionally, he faced criminal charges for
mischief, was hospitalized under a Form 1 due to hypomanic symptoms, and had
his driver's license suspended. Despite these difficulties, the wife remained
married to him and attempted to manage these challenging circumstances for
herself and their family.
[17]          
It is agreed that the wife experienced health issues
during the marriage. Despite these challenges, in 2009, she began working in
several minimum-wage jobs to help with the family’s financial needs. These jobs
included positions at Canada’s Wonderland, Tim Hortons, and the YMCA.
[18]          
According to the wife and their child RA, the husband
secretly planted recording devices in the wife’s purse when she started
working, as well as in the children's belongings. Both the wife and RA
described the husband as being rigid, jealous, and extremely strict in his
behavior.
[19]          
After 28 years of marriage, the parties separated on
February 10, 2019, following an incident in which the husband was charged with
assaulting the wife. Their child RA testified that she and her siblings
witnessed the assault, and she expressed feeling terrified and fearful for her
own safety as well as her mother's during the incident.
[20]          
Since the separation, the wife has solely cared for the
children. The children have chosen not to maintain a relationship with the
husband. The husband shows no insight into how his own behaviors have affected
his relationships with the children. Instead, he blames the wife for the
breakdown of his relationship with them.
[21]          
In September 2022, two years after the separation, the
wife was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. She has since undergone
chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation and is now in remission. However, she
continues to recover from these health issues. In addition, the wife has been
diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious mood, for which
she remains on medication. She is also experiencing extreme financial stress.
Currently, the wife is receiving long-term disability benefits, but these
benefits are set to expire this month.
[22]          
In terms of the litigation history,
[23]          
It is not disputed that other than $400 the
husband paid to the wife towards costs, the outstanding costs orders owing by
the husband to the wife total $9,495.00.
[24]          
Since the parties are married, the Divorce Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) (“DA”), is the applicable statue under
which the child support is being claimed and will be ordered. Any
order for child support is to be made in accordance with the Child Support
Guidelines, SOR/97-175 (“CSG”): s.15.1(3) of the DA.
[25]          
The purpose and promise of child support is to protect the
financial entitlements due to children by their parents: Michel v. Graydon,
2020 SCC 24 (CanLII), [2020] 2 S.C.R. 763 (S.C.C.), at para. 38.
[26]          
A parent-child relationship
is a fiduciary relationship of presumed dependency and the obligation of both parents to support the child
arises at birth; Colucci v Colucci, 2021 SCC 24, 458 D.L.R.
(4th) 183, at para. 36.
[27]          
Child support is the right
of the child, not of the parent seeking support on the child’s behalf, and the basic amount of child support under
the DA, (as well as the Family Law Act) now depends on the
income of the payor and not on a highly discretionary balancing of means and
needs; Kerr v. Baranow 2011 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2011] 1 S.C.R. 269 (S.C.C.), at para. 208.
[28]          
Retroactive awards are a recognized way to enforce such
pre-existing, free-standing obligations and to recover monies owed by yet
unpaid: Michel v. Graydon, at para. 41.
[29]          
It is agreed in this case,
that the husband did not pay child support for the children of the marriage from the time of separation until Faieta,
J. made a temporary child support order on February 24, 2022 (“Faieta interim child
support order”).
[30]          
Retroactive child support is
a claim for monies that should have been paid by the husband to the wife in child support. Child support arrears, on
the other hand, is a calculation of unpaid child support that has accumulated
under an existing support order or agreement.
[31]          
The parties separated on February 10, 2019. I find
that at the time of separation, NA, RA and AA were children of the marriage as
defined in the DA and entitled to child support.
[32]          
At the time of separation, NA was 23 years old.
Despite being over the age of majority, I find that she was still a child of
the marriage entitled to child support, as defined under section 2(1) of the DA.
This is because NA, due to illness and disability, was unable to withdraw from
her parents' care. Although NA receives Ontario Disability Support Payments (“ODSP”),
this does not absolve the husband from his child support obligations under the DA.
The husband still had the financial ability to supplement the support provided
by the state.
[33]          
The Ontario Disability Support Program Act,
1997, S.O. 1997, c. 25, Sched. B. enshrines the objective of creating a shared
responsibility between government and families in meeting the needs of adults
with disabilities. The receipt of ODSP benefits does not in and of itself lead
to disentitlement to child support: see Senos v. Karcz, 2014 ONCA 459,
120 O.R. (3d) 321; Chittle v. Chittle, 2019 ONSC 1433, [2019] O.J. No.
1382; Morden v. Kelly, 2019 ONSC 4620.
[34]          
Section 3(2) of the Federal CSG provides for the following:
[35]          
Accordingly, table child support will be ordered
for NA unless the court considers it “inappropriate”, in which case the quantum
of support shall be determined pursuant to s.3(2)(b).
[36]          
The party seeking to set aside the presumptive
table amount as recommended by the CSG bears the burden of rebutting the
presumption that the table amount is inappropriate: see Francis v. Baker,
1999 CanLII 659 (SCC). If the presumption in s.3(2)(a) is rebutted, child
support can be set above or below the table amount.
[37]          
The wife argues that child support for NA should
be calculated pursuant to s.3(2)(a) using the CSG tables and the husband
should be required to pay full table child support commensurate with his income
effective on the date of separation.
[38]          
The husband argues that NA’s ODSP should be
considered. While he did not refer specifically to s.3(2)(b), the husband
submits that his child support contributions for NA ought to be reduced or
terminated given her ODSP benefits.
[39]          
The leading Ontario case with respect to the
calculation of child support in cases where an adult child with a disability is
receiving ODSP payments and living with a parent is Senos v. Karcz, 2014
ONCA 459. This case confirms that s.3(2)(b) of the CSG remains
applicable under the new regime.
[40]          
Courts have held that an
adult child’s receipt of ODSP benefits is
sufficient to displace the “one-size-fits-most” approach in section 3(2)(a) of
the CSG in favour of the “tailor-made” approach in section
3(2)(b). There is a potential for overlap between child
support payments (which are intended to assist the residential parent to cover the child’s
needs relating to shelter, food and clothing) and ODSP benefits
paid to the recipient child which cover similar needs. ODSP support reflects society’s commitment to sharing
financial responsibility for adults with disabilities; therefore, it makes
little sense to calculate child support on
the basis that this responsibility falls only on the parents. Section 3(2)(b)
should be applied to achieve an equitable balancing of responsibility between
the adult child, his parents and society: see Senos
v. Karcz and Morden v. Kelly at para. 55.
[41]          
The evidence on record confirms that currently,
in 2024, NA is in receipt of ODSP of $1,308 a month, made up a monthly payment
of $752 for her basic needs and $556 toward her shelter. In 2023, NA’s Notice
of Assessment reports line 15000 income of $13,372 derived from ODSP; and in
2022, NA reported income of $11,192 derived from ODSP. There is no evidence
that NA was in receipt of ODSP in 2019, 2020 or 2021.
[42]          
If I find that the table amount of child support under the CSG is
not appropriate for NA, s. 3(2)(b) requires me to determine the
appropriate amount of child support having
regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child and
the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the child.
[43]          
As discussed in Senos v. Karcz, at para 37, the
case Francis v. Baker confirms that s.3 of the CSG establishes a
presumption in favour of the table amount and the party seeking to deviate from
that amount bears the onus of rebutting the presumption. “That party is not obliged to call evidence and may simply
choose to question the opposing party's evidence. However, the evidence
must, in its entirety, be sufficient to raise a concern that the table amount
is inappropriate. There must be "clear and compelling
evidence" for departing from the Guidelines amount. The factors to be
considered in determining both whether the Guidelines approach is
"inappropriate" and the "appropriate" level of support are
the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of the child and the
financial ability of both parents to contribute. Only after examining all
the circumstances of the case should a court find the table amount to be
inappropriate and craft a more suitable support award. To determine
"appropriateness", the court must have sufficient evidence. Trial
judges have the discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a child
expense budget is required and they have the power to order it. When the
presumption in s. 3(2)(a) is rebutted, child support can then be set
above or below the table amount.” [Emphasis added].
[44]          
In paragraph 46 of Senos v.
Karcz, it is stated:
[45]          
I am persuaded that there may be some overlap
between the amounts the husband is obligated to pay for NA's child support and
the income support NA receives from ODSP for board and lodging. It is
reasonable to conclude that a portion of the child support payments is intended
to cover NA's needs, including shelter, food, clothing, and other expenses
associated with raising a child. This means that while the husband must provide
child support, the support from ODSP may also address some of these basic
needs.
[46]          
The difficulty in this case is that there is
insufficient evidence of NA’s condition, means, needs and other circumstances
to enable this court to make a fully informed decision. The wife did not focus
on this issue. There was no evidence to show how the wife uses the ODSP
payments she receives as NA’s trustee, meaning there is no evidence as to how
much, if any, was paid to NA for her benefit or how much, if any, was used to
reimburse the wife for the room and board she provides for NA. There was also
no evidence of NA’s expenses or how she used any portion of the ODSP payments.
There was evidence as to NA’s condition and regarding her being entirely
dependant financially on the wife. The wife’s budget refers to calcium
supplements NA requires. Perhaps most significantly, there was no evidence led
of NA’s disability-related needs, nor of the expenses incurred by the wife that
are attributable to NA.
[47]          
Similarly, the husband
did not put forward any evidence rebutting the
presumption that the table amount under the CSG is inappropriate for NA.
Put simply, there is no clear or compelling evidence on the record before me to
depart from the Guidelines amount.
[48]          
For the years from the date of separation until the end of 2021, I find
that the table amount of the CSG is appropriate for NA, because I have
no evidence on record that she was in receipt of ODSP.
[49]          
However, starting in 2022, I find that the table amount
of child support for NA is inappropriate and under s.3(2)(b) of the CSG,
I have ordered a reduced amount of child support for NA, as outlined below.
[50]          
I also find that until RA graduated
in June 2024, she was a “child of the marriage” as defined in the DA even though she was over 18
years of age, she was enrolled in post-secondary education full-time, entitling
her to child support.
[51]          
It is agreed that AA, being 12
years old at the time of separation and still under the age of 18 today, continues to be a child of the marriage as
defined in the DA entitled to child support.
[52]          
The parental obligation to pay child support, like the
children’s concomitant right to support, exists independently of any statute or
court order, D.B.S., at para. 54.
[53]          
Retroactive awards of child support are not
exceptional. It cannot be exception that children are returned the support they
were rightly due. D.B.S., at para. 97.
[54]          
The husband did not provide any reason for failing to
pay child support for three years after the separation. During his examination
in chief, he testified that he believed he was not required to pay child
support for children over the age of 16, especially since the children did not
want a relationship with him. However, there is no legal basis for the
husband's position, as child support obligations do not automatically cease when
children turn 16, particularly when they are still dependent on their parents
due to factors such as disability or ongoing education.
[55]          
D.B.S. set out the four
factors the court is to consider in awarding retroactive child support where
there is no order or agreement in place for child support. These four factors
are meant to balance the child’s interests in a fair standard of support, the
payor’s interest in flexibility, and the interest of the child and recipient in
certainty and are as follows:
[56]          
In applying the D.B.S. factors to the facts of
this case, I find as follows:
[57]          
For all of the above reasons, I order the husband to
pay retroactive child support for the parties’ three children, NA, RA and AA,
in the sum of $38,794 based on his reported income for the period March 2019 to
and including the end of 2021 (On February 24, 2022,
the Faieta interim child support order was made), calculated as follows:
[58]          
On February 24, 2022, Faieta, J. ordered the husband to pay temporary
child support based on his 2020 income of $61,399 in the table amount of $1,233
a month (“Faieta interim child support order”) starting March 1, 2022. This
order was without prejudice to either party arguing for an adjustment at trial.
[59]          
At the time the Faieta interim child support order was made, the
husband’s 2021 and 2022 income was not known. The only
information on the record regarding the husband’s income was his 2020 income of
$61,399, which is the level of income on which the Faieta interim child support
order was made.
[60]          
The husband’s reported income for 2021, as shown
on his Line 15000, was $54,664.60. However, his reported income for 2022,
according to his Notice of Assessment, was only $8,680. The husband testified
that he worked at Comwave from January 1, 2022, to March 10, 2022. His Record
of Employment indicated he was either dismissed or suspended, and he provided
no explanation for this.
[61]          
The husband also confirmed in cross-examination
that he went to Pakistan to assist his ill brother. He had initially believed
he would be able to work remotely for Comwave, but the company did not allow
this. Instead of returning to Canada to continue supporting the family, he
remained unemployed for the rest of 2022. When asked about whether he applied
for or asked Comwave for severance, the husband confirmed he did not. Prior to
leaving for Pakistan, he had been on track to earn $54,995.20 in 2022, based on
his hourly rate of $26.44.
[62]          
The husband came back to Canada 9 months later,
in January 2023, when he had received a job offer from Key 2 Communications. He
testified that he stayed in Canada from January 2023 until June 2024, when he
returned to Pakistan and has been there since then.
[63]          
In 2023, the husband earned $46,524.22 based on his T4. He did not
provide the wife with a copy of his 2023 Income Tax Return or Notice of
Assessment.
[64]          
In 2024, the husband provided only copies of his pay stubs of $2,000
bi-weekly payments, working 80 hours bi-weekly with Key2 Communications, which
would have amounted to an annual income of $52,000 had he not returned to
Pakistan in June of 2024.
[65]          
The wife argues that the husband should be imputed with an income for
2024 at no less than $48,000 a year. She also submits
that the husband should be imputed with an income equal to at least what he
earned in 2021, namely $54,664.60, for 2022 because the husband voluntarily
stopped working to look after his elder brother in Pakistan despite his obligation
to pay child support for NA, RA and AA.
[66]          
Section 19(1) of the CSG
authorizes the court to impute income to a spouse as it considers appropriate
in certain circumstances, which includes at (a) and (f)  if
[67]          
Drygala v.
Pauli, 2002 CanLII 21868 (ONCA), remains the
leading case on imputing income to a support payor and sets out the test to
apply s.19(1)(a) to the facts of a case as follows:
[68]          
There is no bad faith requirement to a payor
spouse’s under-employment or unemployment: Drygala, at para. 36.
[69]          
As set out in paragraph 38
of Drygala,
[70]          
The test set out in Drygala v Pauli was
recently refined by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Lavie v. Lavie,
[2018] O.J. No. 90 (C.A.). There, Rouleau J.A., speaking for the court, set out
a very clear black line test for intentional underemployment. It is one in
which the subjective reasons for the underemployment, (and by extension,
unemployment) are not relevant. He wrote:
[71]          
Moreover, there is ample case law confirming
that the court may draw an adverse inference against a party where he or she
has failed to make financial disclosure as required by either court order or by
the Rules: See Bagheri-Sadr v. Yaghoub-Azari, 2011 ONSC 611 (CanLII) at
para. 13, and Bardouniotis v. Trypis, 2010 ONSC 4466 (CanLII) at paras.
7 to 9.
[72]          
Where the underemployment or unemployment is the
result of one's own actions (an event over which the payor had some control) or
misconduct, the support obligations will not be reduced or cancelled. (Luckey
v. Luckey, 1996 CanLII 11217 (ON SC), [1996] O.J. No. 1960, Maurucci v. Maurucci 2001
CarswellOnt 4349, Sherwood v. Sherwood (2006) 2006 CanLII 40795 (ON SC), O.J. No. 4860.)
[73]          
In the case at bar, the husband was unemployed
in 2022 and given that he had 3 children of the marriage
entitled to child support, two of whom have special
needs, he had an obligation and duty to seek employment.
[74]          
The husband has not put
forward any evidence regarding his education needs or requirement to retrain.
[75]          
As set out in Drygala at
paras. 44-46,
[76]          
The question is what level of income to impute
to the husband. The evidence
before the court demonstrates that the husband earned $56,333.56 in 2019; $61,399
in 2020; and $54,664.60 in 2021.
[77]          
Although the Faieta interim child support order was
based on the husband’s 2020 income of $61,399, I find that it is appropriate to impute the husband with an income
of $50,000 a year for 2022 onward. It is clear he was able to earn about
$50,000 a year or more than this amount in the three years prior to separation.
An income of $50,000 a year, corresponds to a table CSG obligation of $977
a month for three children.
[78]          
In light of my finding above that full table child support for NA under the CSG
would be inappropriate given that the evidence on the record is that she was in receipt of ODSP in 2022 and 2023,
I have adjusted the child support payable by the husband for NA only.
[79]          
The record demonstrates that for a period of time,
under the Faieta interim child support order, the husband was paying the
mortgage for the matrimonial home of $914 a month, and the property taxes of
$152 a month, totalling $1,066 a month from the time of separation until he
stopped doing so. The wife’s budget shows that she was paying common expenses
for the matrimonial home of $803 a month. The monthly housing expenses,
therefore, for the family totalled $1,869 before the mortgage was refinanced in
2024. I find that a portion of these housing expenses, at least for NA, overlap
with the ODSP payments she receives meant to contribute to her shelter costs.
[80]          
On an imputed income of $50,000 a year for the husband,
the CSG tables dictate that child support for 3 children would be $977 a
month; for 2 children, table child support would be $755 a month; and for 1
child, table child support would be $461 a month. I note that the CSG model recognizes that household expenses do
not increase proportionately with the number of people. Shared living
arrangements reduce per-person costs due to economies of scale. In other words,
the cost of raising 3 children is not simply 3 times the cost of raising 1
child. Hence, the support of 1 child on a payor’s income of $50,000 a year is
$461 a month and not one-third of the support for 3 children under the tables
(i.e. $325.66 a month). Instead, it is higher due to the incremental cost
adjustments dictated by the Statistics Canada 40/30 Equivalence Scale.[2]
[81]          
Accordingly, I find that the
husband shall pay full table child support for 2 children, being RA and AA, for
2022, 2023 and for 6 months in 2024 until RA graduated in June, 2024, which is
$755 a month, using an imputed income for the husband of $50,000.
[82]          
For NA, I find that the husband’s child support payment
should be reduced by $316 a month. This reduction is based on an adjustment to the monthly table child
support amount for 1 child, which is $461 on an income of $50,000. With the
reduction, the new monthly child support the husband is obligated to pay the
wife for NA is set to $145, and his adjusted total child support obligation
becomes $900 a month – comprising of $755 for RA and AA and $145 for NA –
starting from 2022 to the present. This was a decreased from the original table
amount under the CSG of $977 a month.
[83]          
Once RA graduated in June 2024, the husband's table
child support obligation for AA, based on his imputed annual income of $50,000,
was set at $461 per month. The reduced child support obligation for NA remained
at $145 per month. As a result, the husband's combined monthly child support
obligation for both NA and AA was $606, instead of the $755 per month
calculated under the CSG for 2 children.
[84]          
After giving the husband credit for what he paid in
child support since the Faieta interim child support order was made, as enforced by the Family Responsibility Office
(“FRO”), and comparing it with what the husband should have paid in child
support as I have determined above, I find that the husband shall pay the wife
arrears of child support of $8,280.69 for the period 2022 to the present date
is as follows:
[85]          
The Family Responsibility Office (FRO) statement
of arrears, marked as Exhibit #13 at trial, was calculated as of September 9,
2024. If a more updated FRO statement exists, reflecting any additional
payments made by the husband toward child support arrears, the parties are
instructed to determine the amounts paid from September 9, 2024, to the date of
the release of this Endorsement. These payments should then be used to further
reduce the child support arrears, which I find to be owed by the husband in the
amount of $8,280.69.
[86]          
Using an imputed income for the husband of
$50,000 a year, his obligation to pay child support for 2 children, namely, for
NA and AA, amounts to $755 a month pursuant to the tables. However, since I
have found that the husband’s child support for NA should be reduced by $316 a
month, the ongoing amount of child support I find to be appropriate that the
husband owes for NA and AA on a prospective basis is $606 a month.
[87]          
The wife seeks lump sum child support for the
husband’s future child support obligations for NA and AA. Given that the
husband lives in Pakistan, he has indicated that he has no intention of
returning to Canada, and there is no reciprocal support enforcement legislation
in Pakistan, the wife seeks lump sum child support.
[88]          
The  Federal CSG authorize the court to
make a lump sum child support order at s.11.
[89]          
Lump sum orders of child support have been made
in circumstances where the court has determined that it would be inappropriate
to make an order for periodic payments. As set out in Makeeva v. Makeev,
2021 ONCA 232, at para 11; K. v. B., 2022 ONSC 7181, those circumstances
include:
[90]          
In Khadra v. Kjadra, 2021 ONSC 3599, at
para 50, the court held that a lump sum payment can be made where the payor has
a history of failing to make support payments or resides in a country that does
not have reciprocal enforcement of judgment legislation through which the child
support payments can be enforced: Tu v. Tu (2000), 2000 CanLII 22591 (ON
SC), 7 R.F.L. (5th) 178 (Ont. Sup. Ct.).
[91]          
In Mwanri v. Mwanri, 2015 ONCA 843, 2015
CarswellOnt 18511, Cronk J.A. wrote for the Ontario Court of Appeal that both
the FLA and the DA “afford family law judges a broad discretion
to award periodic or lump sum spousal support, or to make an award comprising
both forms of support.”
[92]          
In this case, the husband never voluntarily paid
child support and has not complied with previous child support orders. He is
currently unemployed in Pakistan, and the court is persuaded that he may have
an inability to make periodic child support payments to the wife. Furthermore,
even if the husband were able to pay child support, Pakistan is not a reciprocating
jurisdiction under the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act, 2002, S.O.
2002, c. 13. which would complicate the enforcement of any support orders
issued in Canada.
[93]          
Accordingly, I find it appropriate to exercise
my discretion by ordering lump sum prospective child support payment for AA and
NA. While the wife did not specify the amount sought, the court considered
relevant factors, including the likelihood of AA pursuing post-secondary
education, as three of his older siblings (excluding NA) had done. Assuming AA
will remain a child of the marriage for the next 4.5 years, which includes a
four-year post-secondary degree, I have calculated the husband’s obligation at
$7,272 per year for 4.5 years ($606 per month for 54 months), totaling $32,724
for both AA and NA. I so order the husband to pay this amount as a lump sum in
satisfaction of his future child support obligations for AA and NA (only until
and including June of 2029).
[94]          
Commencing July 1, 2029 and on the first day of
each following month, until further court order or agreement of the parties,
the husband shall pay child support for NA pursuant to s.3(2)(b) of the CSG in
the sum of $145 a month, using an imputed income of $50,000 for the husband.
[95]          
Section 15.2(1) and (3) of the DA sets
out the court’s jurisdiction to make either an interim or final order requiring
a spouse to pay such spousal support as the court considers reasonable. The
general objectives of spousal support are found in s. 15.2(6) of the DA and
are to,
[96]          
According to Bracklow v. Bracklow 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999]
1 SCR 420 (S.C.C.) entitlement to spousal support must be established prior to
determining the quantum and duration of a spousal support order. The three
groups of entitlement to spousal support are a) compensatory; b) contractual;
and c) non-compensatory; Bracklow, at para. 15.
[97]          
Section 15.2(4) of the DA outlines the
factors that the court must consider in making a spousal support order which
are the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse,
including a) the length of time the spouses cohabited; b) the
functions performed by each spouse during cohabitation; and c) any
order, agreement or arrangement relating to support of either spouse.
[98]          
In Moge v. Moge, 1992 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 (S.C.C.), at
para. 48, L’Heureux-Dube J. concisely summarized the overall goal of the
spousal support provisions of the DA as being to effect “a
fair and equitable distribution of resources to alleviate the economic
consequences of marriage or marriage breakdown for both spouses, regardless of
gender.”
[99]          
Formulating an appropriate spousal support award
is a highly individual and discretionary exercise that requires the court to
carefully balance the numerous support objectives and factors set out in
the DA in the context of the particular facts of the case
before the court (Racco v. Racco,  2014 ONCA 330(C.A.)).
[100]      
Given the 28-year duration of the marriage, the
roles the wife assumed in managing the household and raising the children, and
the husband's expectations of her in these roles, I find that the wife has both
a compensatory and needs-based entitlement to spousal support. Additionally,
the wife's health, including a cancer diagnosis following the separation,
affects her ability to achieve self-sufficiency. The husband did not contest
the wife's entitlement to spousal support but argued that he lacks the financial
capacity to make such payments.
[101]      
Once entitlement is determined the Court must
determine the quantum of duration of spousal support. The Spousal Support
Advisory Guidelines (“SSAGs”) are advisory guidelines which suggest
appropriate ranges of spousal support once entitlement has been established.
[102]      
Duration of spousal support under the SSAGs
is “indefinite” when the relationship is over 20 years or long or when the
“rule of 65” applies. Indefinite support does not necessarily mean permanent
support. It only means that no time limit can be set at the time of the order.
The Revised User Guidelines to the SSAGs explain that the SSAGs
use the term “indefinite (duration not specified) to cover that indefinite
orders are subject to variation and review.
[103]      
The wife is seeking lump sum spousal support in
the sum of $82,068 which she calculates to represent the high-end range of the SSAGs,
using an income for the husband of $48,000, plus CPP benefits and OAS payments,
totalling $19,575 and other non-taxable income of $1,500. This calculation was made
Exhibit #15 at trial, and was based on a total income for the husband of
$69,801, an income of $19,644 for the wife, representing her current LTD
payments, and child support for three children. The wife argues that the husband’s
unconscionable misconduct, perpetrated by his physical, sexual, and
psychological abuse toward her, are relevant to the other factors the court
should consider in making a spousal support order.
[104]      
I do not find the wife’s calculations to be
correct because, she acknowledges that there are currently only 2 children of
the marriage entitled to support and her calculations are for 3 children, and the
additional income of $19,575 she attributes to the husband, has not been proven
on the record to be accurate or in existence currently.
[105]      
Further, the wife asks the court to make a
finding of family violence as further support for using the high-end range of
the SSAGs, relying on A.C. v. K.C., 2023 ONSC 6017, in which
Justice Mandhane provided the following general propositions about misconduct
in spousal support claims:
[106]      
I do find that the wife experienced family
violence at the hands of the husband and that the children were exposed to
family violence. However, even without that finding, I find that the
appropriate range of the SSAGs to determine the quantum of spousal
support is the high-end of the range, given the strength of the wife’s
compensatory claim and given that the level of the husband’s income is such
that the SSAGs do not generate spousal support quantum’s until there is
only one child entitled to child support, given the priority of child support
over spousal support.
[107]      
In terms of the wife’s request for lump sum
future spousal support, s. 15.2(2) of the DA allows the court to make
lump sum orders in the context of interim applications for spousal support.
[108]      
Nothing in either the DA restricts a
court's ability to award lump sum spousal support to situations where there is
a real risk that periodic payments would not be made or to other limited and
very unusual circumstances: Davis v. Crawford, 2011 ONCA 294. In Davis
v. Crawford, the court affirmed the trial judge's award of lump sum support
where it was apparent from the judge's reasons that she had a real concern that
the husband would not pay periodic support and that she felt it necessary to
effect a clean break between the parties.
[109]      
Lump sum spousal support orders are
discretionary and case specific, and can be justified by a wide variety of
circumstances: Davis v. Crawford, above; Aksman v. Shenderey,
2011 ONCA 816. In Aksman v. Shenderey, there was no basis to interfere
with the trial judge's award of lump sum support where his reasons provided an
adequate foundation for the order and he weighed the advantages and
disadvantages of a lump sum award, including the fact that the husband was
chronically late in his support payments.
[110]      
I find that this is a case where a lump sum
spousal support award should be ordered, for the same reasons that I have
ordered future lump sum child support. The husband is currently unemployed in
Pakistan and I question his ability to make periodic spousal support payments
to the wife. Further, given that there is no reciprocal support legislation in
Pakistan, it would be impossible for the wife to enforce a spousal support
order of this court.
[111]      
I note that for as long as the husband is
obliged to continue to pay child support for AA and NA, there is no ability for
him to pay spousal support to the wife. The SSAGs show a $0 amount available
for child support given the priority given to child support under section
15.3(1) of the DA. However, once the husband’s child support for AA
terminates, and he is only paying child support for NA in the reduced sum of
$145 a month, the SSAGs produce a range of spousal support for the wife
at $250 a month in the high-end of the range. The lump sum calculation of
spousal support on the high-end range of spousal support is $62,127 using the
mid-point of the net present value of that lump sum pursuant to the SSAGs.[3] Accordingly, I order the
husband to pay the wife lump sum spousal support of $62,127.
[112]      
Pursuant to s.5(1) of the Family Law Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3 (“FLA”), the spouse with the higher net family property
(“NFP”) owes the other spouse one-half of the difference between the two
parties’ NFPs, which is referred to as an equalization payment (“EP”).
[113]      
The wife’s sworn financial statement
demonstrates that her NFP is $142,762.96. The husband’s NFP is $167,196.98. Based
on these numbers, the wife submits that the husband owes her an EP of
$12,217.01. The husband did not put forward any evidence disputing the wife’s
calculations of her NFP. I agree with the wife’s analysis and find that the
husband owes the wife an EP of $12,217.01.
[114]      
There are also post-separation adjustments that
need to be accounted for since the date of separation.
[115]       In
July 2019, the mortgage registered on title to the matrimonial home needed to
be refinanced to allow the parties to pay off a joint credit card debt owing to
the Bank of Montreal. It is agreed that the husband arranged for the
refinancing of the mortgage through the Bank of Montreal and retained a lawyer,
Abraham Jonas to complete this refinancing. At that time, the mortgage in
favour of the Royal Bank of Canada was discharged in the sum of $103,917.33 and
a new mortgage in favour of Bank of Montreal was obtained in the sum of
$200,000. With the additional financing of $95,082.67, the husband paid off his
personal debts, the parties’ joint credit card debt in favour of BMO, and the
parties received $31,819.70 which was placed in a joint bank account at BMO.
The husband had also secured a line of credit for $60,000, which the wife asked
the bank to close after separation so no funds were taken by him. The wife
transferred $12,000 into her own personal account.
[116]       The
wife claims that only the husband obtained the benefit of this refinancing.
Specifically, she states that after separation, the husband
withdrew $84,546 from the equity of the matrimonial home to his sole benefit. I
do not agree that the wife has met the onus of establishing that the husband
had the sole benefit of this $84,546. It is agreed that the sum of $31,819.70
was placed into a joint account. She also acknowledges that the funds from the
refinancing were used to pay off joint credit card debt. The wife did not
produce evidence to verify that this joint credit card was incurred for the
husband’s sole benefit. Further, the wife did not identify what amount of debt
belonged to the husband alone that was discharged. Accordingly,
I do not find that the husband should reimburse the wife for 50% of this
refinanced equity of $42,273, as she seeks.
[117]       The
mortgage in favour of BMO registered on title to the matrimonial home was due
for renewal on August 1, 2024. The evidence demonstrates that the husband
refused to cooperate with signing the renewal documents and stopped paying for
the mortgage. As a result, the wife was forced to renew the mortgage a very
high fixed rate of 9.85% for a 6-month fixed term, which
increased the mortgage payments significantly. The next mortgage renewal date
is February 1, 2025.
[118]       The wife claims that the husband owes her post-separation
adjustments of $59,557.90, in addition to the EP, representing expenses she
paid for solely in connection with the matrimonial home fifty percent of which
was his responsibility, as follows:
[119]      
Accordingly, I find that the husband owes the
wife the total sum of $4,785.50 on account of post-separation adjustments +
$9,495 on account outstanding costs orders, for a  total $14,280.50.
[120]      
The husband argues that he should receive credit
for the following payments he made toward the matrimonial home post separation:
[121]      
Accordingly, I find that the wife owes the
husband the total sum of $12,773.19 on account of post-separation adjustments.
[122]      
The NFP calculations lists the matrimonial home
as jointly owned on each party’s side of the ledger. According to the wife’s
evidence the current fair market value of the matrimonial home is $475,000. The
mortgage registered on title is $172,000, leaving equity of about $303,000 in
the home. Divided by two, the husband’s half share of the equity in the
matrimonial home amounts to $151,500. The husband did not put forward any
evidence to the contrary regarding the current fair market value of the
matrimonial home. Accordingly, I accept the value as put forward by the wife.
[123]      
The wife submits that if the husband pays her
the EP owing to her, along with the post-separation adjustments, retroactive
child support, child support arrears, lump sum child support and lump sum spousal
support that would add up to more than his half-share of the equity in the
matrimonial home. On this basis, she submits that the husband should transfer
his 50% of the equity in the matrimonial home to her in satisfaction of these
obligations. In essence, she asks the court to grant a vesting order so the
husband’s obligations can be satisfied by transferring his half-interest in the
home to her.
[124]      
The power to grant a vesting order, including an
order under s.34(1)(c) of the FLA was decided in Lynch v. Segal,
2006 CanLII 42240, which confirms that the court’s broad general power to grant
a vesting order is found in s.100 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C. 43. In the specific context of family law claims, ss. 9(1)(d)(i)
and 34(1)(c) of the FLA confer an equally broad power to grant a vesting
order on an application for equalization of net family property or support,
respectively. Vesting orders are discretionary and have their origins in the
court's equitable jurisdiction.
[125]      
Before a court will make an order requiring that
property be transferred to or vested in the dependant, the onus is on the
person seeking a vesting order to show that such an order is necessary to
ensure that the payor complies with his payment obligations. There should be
some reasonable relationship between the amount of the payor spouse’s support
liability and the value of the property to be vested in the recipient spouse.
Each case must be decided on its own unique facts, as noted by the Ontario
Court of Appeal in Lynch v. Segal, below (at para. 32)
[126]      
Further, before a vesting order can be made, it
must be based on proper calculations: Rasile v. Rasile, 2011 ONSC 2851.
[127]      
I calculate that the amounts owing by the
husband to the wife total $155,652.51 broken down as follows:
[128]      
Given that the husband’s 50% share in the equity
of the matrimonial home is equal to  $151,500, I find that in the circumstances
of this case, the husband’s half-share in the matrimonial home shall be vested
in the name of the wife in satisfaction of all outstanding support and property
claims the wife may have against him, including for retroactive child support,
child support arrears, future child support, spousal support, equalization of
net family property, post-separation adjustments, and outstanding costs orders,
including pre-and post-judgment interest.
[129]      
 Section 46(1) of
the FLA provides the court with jurisdiction to make an
interim restraining order.
While generally restraining orders in family law matters are made against a spouse or former spouse restraining that spouse from having direct or
indirect contact with the other spouse, s.46(3) permits the court to make a restraining order that
contacts any other provisions that it considers appropriate.
[130]      
The test for whether a restraining order should be granted under s.46 of the FLA is whether the moving party
“has reasonable grounds to fear for his or her own safety or for the safety of
any child in his or her lawful custody.” In Khara v. McManus, 2007
CarswellOnt (C.J.), a trial of an application for a restraining order, Dunn, J. stated at para 33, that
[131]      
The strength of the evidence
in support of the restraining order was considered in Callon v. Callon, [1999] O.J. No. 3108 (Div. Court) which was a
motion for leave to appeal an order restraining a party from communicating to third
parties about the moving party. The court considered the issue of an
interim restraining order under s.46 of the FLA.
The panel stated that “purpose of s.46 as it relates to
interim orders is to permit both litigants
the opportunity to conduct their litigation in as reasoned an atmosphere as may
be possible.”  In P.F. v. S.F., 2011
ONSC 154 (CanLII), McDermot, J. interpreted Callon to
mean, “the reason for a restraining order is to provide the litigants with some element
of order in the context of difficult and
acrimonious litigation.”
[132]      
The wife argues that she and the children will
continue to be traumatized by contact with the husband, which is the reason she
seeks a final restraining order. RA has testified that she remains fearful for
her safety and for that of her mother in the presence of the father. RA and the
wife testified that AA is extremely fearful of the husband.
[133]      
A restraining order is
necessary where parties are unable to restrain themselves and require
the state to tell them how to behave; Lazier v Mackey 2012
ONSC 3812 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No.
3308. It is, however, serious and should not be ordered unless a
clear case has been made out: Ciffolillo v.
Niewelglowski, 2007 ONCJ 469.  In
addition to the criminal consequences of breaches, a restraining order will also likely appear when a
criminal record search is conducted. As such, a restraining order could
have an impact on a person’s employment, ability to travel and immigration
status: F.K. v. M.C., 2017 ONCJ 181.
[134]      
It is not necessary for the husband
to have committed an act, gesture or words of harassment, to justify a restraining order.
Rather, it must be established that the applicant has a reasonable fear of such acts being
committed:  Fuda v. Fuda, 2011 ONSC
154. The applicant’s fear can be subjective, but it must be related
to the respondent’s actions or words: Fuda v. Fuda, supra, 2011 ONSC 154; Khara v. McManus, 2007 CarswellOnt 3159
(Ont. C.J.). A
person's subjective fear can extend to both the person's physical
safety and psychological safety: Azimi
v. Mirzaei, 2010 CarswellOnt 4464 (Ont. S.C.J.).
[135]      
The DA defines family violence in the following
terms:
[136]      
The negative effects of
family violence on children are well known. The perpetrator poses a risk of harm to children even after the
separation and even if the perpetrator has not physically assaulted the
children: Ganie v. Ganie, (2014) O.J.
6332 (S.C.).
[137]      
I find as follows:
[138]      
Based on the above, I find that there are
reasonable grounds to fear for the safety of the wife and the children and
grant the restraining order as a result.
[139]      
The husband did not lead any evidence at trial regarding
decision-making responsibility or parenting time with
the children since the parenting issues were resolved prior to trial.[4]
However, in his closing submissions, despite having received clear guidance
from the court that nothing in his closing submissions could refer to evidence
not on the trial record, the husband makes reference to the following issues:
[140]      
The court mentions the issues raised by the
husband in his closing submissions to address the fact that none of the issues
raised by him referred to in paragraph 138 above are relevant to the issues
decided at trial.
[141]      
This Court makes the following order:
