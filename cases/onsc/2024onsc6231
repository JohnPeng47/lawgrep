The plaintiff, Mattamy (Jock River) Ltd., moves
for default judgment against the defendant, Moruf Abiodun Olatunji Ishola. The
plaintiff is a property developer and homebuilder in Ottawa. The plaintiff
seeks damages of $87,714.49 plus pre- and post-judgment interest flowing from the
defendant’s failure to close on a real estate transaction in February 2024. In
support of the relief sought, the plaintiff filed an affidavit and a
supplementary affidavit from Michael Winiarz, Vice-President of Marketing and
Sales for Ottawa Mattamy Holmes Ltd. At the relevant time, Mr. Winiarz was
responsible for supervising and directing the sale of new homes for the
plaintiff corporation. Mr. Winiarz instructed the plaintiff’s real estate
solicitors in respect of the contract giving rise to this action.
[2]              
On or about October 17, 2022, the parties
entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale (the “Agreement”) for real
property known municipally as 25 Stitch Mews, Ottawa, Ontario (the “Property”).
The final purchase price was $538,709.00, inclusive of HST. The transaction was
scheduled to close on February 8, 2024.
[3]              
Pursuant to the Agreement, the defendant was to
pay deposits in instalments. The defendant paid a total of $14,000 in deposits,
but subsequently defaulted on his obligation to make payments due from December
17, 2022 onward. The plaintiff’s solicitors sent the defendant a letter dated
May 19, 2023, advising him that he had defaulted under the Agreement. The
defendant did not respond.
[4]              
On December 18, 2023, the plaintiff’s solicitors
wrote to the defendant a second time, requesting payment of all outstanding
deposits. The defendant did not respond, nor did he make any of the required
payments.
[5]              
On January 11, 2024, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote
to the defendant via mail, courier, and email, advising the defendant that the Agreement
was terminated, and that it would remarket the property to mitigate its
damages.
[6]              
On January 27, 2024, the plaintiff re-sold the
Property for a final purchase price of $462,830.00, including HST. The sale
closed on April 25, 2024.
[7]              
The plaintiff commenced an action on April 2,
2024. The plaintiff served the defendant with the statement of claim on April
16, 2024. The defendant did not defend the action. On May 30, 2024, the
plaintiff wrote to the defendant via email and mail, advising him that if he
did not file a statement of defence by June 7, 2024, the plaintiff would note the
defendant in default and move for default judgment. The defendant did not
respond.
[8]              
The plaintiff provided the defendant one further
opportunity to file a defence via letter dated June 12, 2024, in which it
extended the deadline to file to June 21, 2024. The defendant did not respond
or defend the action.
[9]              
The plaintiff noted the defendant in default on
July 9, 2024. On August 27, 2024, the plaintiff’s solicitors advised the
defendant via email that he had been noted in default and that the plaintiff
would be scheduling a motion for default judgment. The defendant did not
respond. The plaintiff subsequently served the defendant with a courtesy copy
of the notice of motion and motion record.
[10]          
The plaintiff now seeks default
judgment against the defendant pursuant to r. 19.05 of the Rules. The
plaintiff seeks to recover its financial losses associated with the defendant’s
failure to close on the Property. Pursuant to r. 19.02(1)(a), the defendant is
deemed to have admitted the truth of the following allegations as set out in
the originating statement of claim:
[11]          
Do the facts as admitted entitle the
plaintiff to judgment pursuant to r. 19.06? First, the court must be satisfied
based on the deemed admissions that the defendant breached the Agreement as
plead in the statement of claim. If so, the court must then determine the
quantum of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.
[12]          
If the facts based on the admitted
allegations do not entitle the plaintiff to default judgment, then the
plaintiff must adduce admissible evidence, which when combined with the deemed
admissions, forms a sufficient evidentiary foundation for the relief sought.
Conclusions of law, or mixed fact and law, are not deemed admitted by virtue of
r. 19.02(1) where a defendant has been noted in default: Paul’s Transport
Inc. v. Immediate Logistics Ltd, 2022 ONCA 573.
[13]          
 When the damages are unliquidated as in this case, in accordance with r.
19.05(2), the motion shall be supported
by affidavit evidence. The court must be satisfied by the evidence filed that
the facts entitle the plaintiff to judgment including
facts substantiating the calculation of the requested damages. Moreover,
where a plaintiff seeks default judgment in the context of an aborted sale of
real estate, the plaintiff must also satisfy the court
that they made reasonable efforts to resell the property for fair market value
in a timely manner: Madison Homes Cornell Rouge Ltd. v. Ng, 2021 ONSC
3104.
[14]          
I am satisfied that the defendant
breached the terms of the Agreement. The Agreement required the defendant to
pay $18,000 in deposits from December 17, 2022, onwards. He failed to do so
despite being warned about the non-payment via letters dated May 19, 2023, and
December 18, 2023.
[15]          
I will now assess the damages to
which the plaintiff is entitled.
[16]          
In all proceedings where a
plaintiff seeks damages with respect to a breach of an agreement of purchase
and sale, the plaintiff must prove the quantum of damages to which it is
entitled: Madison Homes, at para. 18. Damages in this
context are the difference between the contract price and the price of the new
sale of the property, plus any related costs associated with the breach: Goldstein
v. Goldar, 2018 ONSC 608, at para. 25.
[17]          
 Further, in the context of a failed real estate transaction, the
plaintiff must prove that its efforts to resell were “reasonable and timely”: Madison
Homes, at para. 18; 100 Main Street Ltd., v. W.B. Sullivan Construction
Ltd. (1978), 1978 CanLII 1630 (ON CA), 88 D.L.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 23. The innocent party has
a duty to mitigate: Rosehaven Homes Ltd. v. Aluko, [2022] O.J. No. 838,
at para. 71.
[18]          
When assessing whether the innocent party took reasonable steps to
minimize the losses incurred, the court may consider the circumstances of the
real estate market at the time; how long it took for the innocent party to
place the property for sale; how long the property was for sale before it sold;
how the property was marketed; at what price the property was relisted for
sale; how the property was exposed for sale; whether there were any price
reductions or other offers to purchase the property; and, how many other offers
were made and their particulars: Rosehaven Homes Ltd, at para. 73. The
onus lies on the innocent party to prove on a balance of probabilities that the
damages sought are reasonable and flow from the breach claimed: Rosehaven
Homes Ltd., at para. 74.
[19]          
I am satisfied that the plaintiff made reasonable efforts to resell the
property for fair market value in a timely manner. On January 22, 2024, the plaintiff
remarketed the Property on MLS without delay after a consideration of recent
sales in the area. The new listing price was $459,990.00. The lower listing
price as compared to the original purchase price in the Agreement reflected the
significant downturn the real estate market experienced in Ottawa since the
parties entered into the Agreement in 2022. The plaintiff also marketed the
Property on its website and through its internal network of realtors.
[20]          
In late January 2024, the plaintiff received two offers on the Property.
The first offer fell through due to financing. A second offer was made for the
listing price of $459,990.00. The plaintiff accepted the offer on February 1,
2024. The final purchase price after amendments was $462,830.00.
[21]          
In my view, the plaintiff re-listed the Property at fair market value, on
the open market, and accepted an offer for a reasonable price. I am satisfied
that the plaintiff made appropriate efforts to mitigate its losses.
[22]          
Having found that the plaintiff fulfilled its duty to mitigate, I am prepared
to assess the damages as the difference between the purchase price in the
Agreement and the ultimate resale price of the Property. The contract price of
the Property inclusive of HST was $538,709.00. The resale price of the Property
inclusive of HST was $462,830.00. This creates a shortfall of $75,879.00.
[23]          
The plaintiff also seeks the following ancillary damages:
[24]          
I am satisfied that these costs
flow from the defendant’s failure to close the transaction and are reasonable
in the circumstances.
[25]          
After deducting the $14,000 paid
in deposits by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to $87,714.49 in
damages.
[26]          
For the above reasons, default
judgment is granted in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, in the
amount of $87,714.49, plus prejudgment interest accruing from January 11, 2024,
in accordance with the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O., 1990, c.
C.43, s. 128. Post-judgment interest shall also apply
in accordance with the Courts of Justice Act.
[27]          
Regarding costs, the matter was
straightforward in nature and the applicable law well-settled. I fix costs
payable at a partial indemnity rate in the amount of $3000, inclusive of HST
and disbursements.
