[1]          Elmi Ibrahim and Samatar Hamadu are charged
on a nine-count indictment under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
S.C. 1996, c. 19 (the “CDSA”) and the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46. A jury trial in this matter is scheduled to commence on January
13, 2025.
[2]          The accused apply to quash a CDSA search
warrant issued for premises located at 2646 Victoria Ave East, Thunder
Bay (“2646”).  The warrant also covered two other premises which were not contested
on this application.
[3]          The Information to Obtain (“ITO”) warrant
was provided by Detective Constable Dennis Vincent.  It was sworn April 5,
2022.  The ITO contained information obtained from confidential informants.  A
redacted copy of the ITO has been provided to the defence by the Crown.
[4]          The parties have engaged in Steps 1 to 4 of
the so-called Garofoli process and have now reached Step 5: see R. v.
Garofoli, 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421.  A redacted ITO, including a judicial
summary of the redactions, has been provided to the accused.  As a result of a
subsequent agreement between counsel for Mr. Ibrahim and the Crown, further
material was excised from the ITO.  This further amended ITO was made as
Exhibit 1 on this hearing.   It was this version of the ITO that the court
considered in assessing the merits of both accused’s positions on the present
application.
[5]          The accused were granted leave and
conducted a limited cross examination of the affiant, Detective Constable
Vincent, on November 18, 2024.
[6]          The issue for resolution is whether the ITO,
as edited, supports the authorization for the search of 2646.
[7]          Judicial authorizations are presumptively
valid: see R. v. Beauchamp, 2015 ONCA 260, 326 C.C.C. (3d) 280, at para.
85. The applicants bear the burden of establishing that there was an
insufficient basis for the issuance of the warrant: see R. v. Collins,
1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at para.21. This is not a de novo hearing, and I am
not entitled to substitute my views of the ITO over that of the issuing justice:
see R. v. Reid, 2016 ONCA 524, 132 O.R. (3d) 26, at para. 73.
[8]          Section 11(1) of the CDSA states as follows:
[9]          In seeking an ex parte
authorization, the affiant must provide full and frank disclosure of material facts;
however, an ITO need not include every minute detail of the police
investigation: see R. v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, 2 S.C.R. 992, at para. 46.
[10]      In dealing with a matter, the ITO must be read as a
whole: see R. v. Nero, 2016 ONCA 160, 334 C.C.C. (3d) 148, at para. 84.
[11]      An issuing justice is entitled to draw reasonable
inferences from evidence in the ITO, in the absence of direct evidence: see R.
v. Wu, 2013 SCC 60, 3 S.C.R. 657.  Common sense inferences may also be
drawn from evidence contained in an ITO: see R. v. Baskaran, 2020
ONCA 25, 149 O.R. (3d) 409.  An affiant is not required to satisfy an issuing
justice that it is more likely than not that the things to be searched for are
at the location to be searched: see R. v. Kalonji, 2022 ONCA 415, 162
O.R. (3d) 283, at para. 29. However, permissible inferences must be more than
mere speculation: see R. v. Coluccio, 2019 ONSC 4559, 440 C.R.R. (2d)
114.
[12]      Counsel for the accused were succinct, focused, and
straightforward in their submissions.  While there was evidence that one of the
subjects of the investigation – a person with the street name “EZ” or “Easy” – had
committed drug trafficking offences at other locations in Thunder Bay, the ITO contained
no direct evidence connecting 2646 to this drug trafficking activity. 
For ease of reference, I will refer to this person as “Easy” going forward.
[13]      While the ITO provided direct evidence of Easy coming
and going from 2646, counsel for Mr. Ibrahim submits that there was no evidence,
nor even an appropriate inference to be drawn, that drug activity or evidence
of any such offences would be found at that location.
[14]      Counsel for Mr. Ibrahim argued that the affiant had
misrepresented certain facts in the ITO.  He took issue with the contents of
para. 41 (a), which stated as follows:
[15]      Police had obtained a 60-day tracking device for a
phone associated to Easy, pursuant to a warrant obtained in February 2022.  The
ITO contained information from D/C Vincent regarding Easy’s whereabouts, as
revealed by the tracking device operating from late February 2022 through to
the time the ITO was sworn.   In cross examination, D/C Vincent admitted that
the tracker used to follow a phone associated to Easy had a varying degree of
accuracy with respect to exactly where on the ground the phone was located; D/C
Vincent testified that the tracker could vary up to 400 to 700 meters from the
actual location of the phone at any given time.  Based on that evidence,
counsel for Mr. Ibrahim argued that it was a misrepresentation to say that Easy
remained primarily at 2646.
[16]      The Crown argued that it was open to the issuing
justice to accept D/C Vincent’s evidence that, based on his experience and the
direct observations of Easy by police, a search of 2646 Victoria would provide
evidence of an offence contemplated by s. 11.1 of the CDSA.
[17]      I am persuaded by the Crown’s argument that the
redacted ITO before the Court on this application provided reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that evidence of drug trafficking would be found at
2646.  In my view, the ITO contained compelling, credible, and corroborated evidence
of Easy’s participation in drug-related activities across Thunder Bay. 
The information from the various CIs placed Easy at different locations
in Thunder Bay where drug transactions were taking place. Information from CIs
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 collectively included the following details:
[18]      The totality of evidence was sufficient to establish
that Easy was an active participant in criminal activity in Thunder Bay.
[19]      D/C Vincent provided the issuing justice with evidence
of his experience regarding drug trafficking methods in Thunder Bay at
the time.  While I am not entitled to substitute my views for that of the
issuing justice  I assess this information as reasonable and accurate; it is
consistent with expert and participant evidence heard in numerous drug trials that I have presided over in the past few years here in Thunder Bay.  Drug
trafficking in Thunder Bay is now extremely lucrative, and many drug
dealers from Southern Ontario are attracted by the elevated price for
drugs that can be obtained from sales in trap houses across the city.
[20]      The drug trade, as described by D/C Vincent, relies on
a particular business model.  Out of town dealers rely on a network of trap
houses, where sales are made, and safe houses, which are chosen and operated so
as not to draw the attention of police or rivals.  Safe houses serve to protect
 significant profits, and act as a storehouse for storage of larger amounts of product. 
The safe house is a necessary component to the drug trade, as the main
participants do not ordinarily reside in Thunder Bay.  This information is
contained at paras. 6, 7, 8, 13, 36, 37, 38, and 41 of the ITO.
[21]      Easy’s connection to the trap houses identified in
the ITO, along with his return to the alleged safe house, 2646, is set out in
paras. 61, 63, and 66 of the ITO. The fact that Easy was not ordinarily residing
in Thunder Bay is plain and obvious from the comings and goings indicated by
the tracker on a phone associated to him.  The connection to 2646 is confirmed
by multiple direct observations by police of Easy entering the premises. 
In my view, a reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence in the ITO that
the volume and scope of Easy’s drug operation, involving multiple
locations in Thunder Bay, combined with the number of times Easy had
come and gone from the city, indicated that a safe house base of operations had
to be located somewhere in Thunder Bay.  D/C Vincent’s experience with how drug
trafficking enterprises were organized in Thunder Bay in the spring of 2022
allowed the issuing justice to draw a reasonable inference that the 2646 was a
safe house, and that a search of it would provide evidence of criminal activity
related to drug trafficking.
[22]      I was not persuaded by Mr. Ibrahim’s argument that the
affiant misled or attempted to mislead the issuing justice by the statements contained
in para. 41 of the ITO.  The ITO must be considered as a whole.  There is a
great deal of other evidence included that does fairly and frankly acknowledge
the limits on the tracker while nevertheless providing a general area of the city
where Easy was frequenting at times material to the ITO: see para. 53, ITO.  
That area of the city is around 2646.  Furthermore, the ITO demonstrates that
the phone was moving around the province, including time spent in the GTA and
in Wawa, heading towards Sudbury: see paras. 50–51.  It is a notorious fact
that if one is driving to the GTA from Thunder Bay, on the southern route, a
stop in Wawa is usually followed by a stop in Sudbury as they are approximately
6 hours apart by way of Highway 17.   In my view, the issuing justice
would not have been misled by the statements in para. 41, in context of other
material in the ITO.  It is clear that the affiant is stating his belief, based
on all of the evidence of Easy’s activity in Thunder Bay, that Easy remained
mostly in the area of 2646, which therefore allowed a reasonable
inference to be drawn that the residence was a safe house.  At para. 12, the
affiant notes that Easy had been back and forth from the Toronto area to
Thunder Bay on three separate occasions.  The issuing justice could take
judicial notice that Thunder Bay is approximately 1400 kilometers from Toronto
by car.  In context of the entirety of the redacted ITO, para. 41 is not
misleading.
[23]      In my view, the redacted ITO was not drafted in a way
designed to confuse or misdirect the issuing justice as to the situation of the
police investigation.  In my view, it was full, fair, and frank even as
redacted.  The information from the CIs and the police was credible,
corroborated, and compelling. In my view, the ITO, as redacted in Exhibit 1,
supports the authorization for the search of 2646.   The authorization is
confirmed.
[24]      The applications to quash by both accused are
dismissed.  The  evidence obtained by police during the search of 2646 will be
admissible at trial.
[25]      Counsel are to contact the trial coordinator to set a
time for a one hour trial management conference sometime in the week of
December 16, 2024.
