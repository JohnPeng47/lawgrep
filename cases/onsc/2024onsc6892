[1]              
The applicant, the Public Guardian and Trustee (“PGT”),
requests an order that the respondent Jason Snelgrove (Jason), reimburse the
amount of $256,073.50 to the PGT who is the guardian of his mother, Loreen Snelgrove
(“Loreen”).  She is a vulnerable senior citizen and PGT claims that this amount
was misappropriated from January 1, 2019 to March 12, 2024.
[2]              
Loreen is 76 years old and suffers from
dementia. She is currently at the Garry J. Armstrong home, a long-term care
facility.  Her husband, Lee Snelgrove passed away in January 2015.
[3]              
Jason was her attorney pursuant to a Power of
Attorney for property dated May 10, 2017.
[4]              
The respondent, Dale Snelgrove (Dale), was named
as the alternate attorney. Although served with this Application, he did not
formally respond and indicated that he did not wish to be an attorney.
[5]              
On August 12, 2024, this court declared that
Loreen was mentally incapable of managing her own property and appointed the
PGT as Loreen’s guardian of property. The matter was adjourned to permit Jason
to provide evidence of the accounting of monies with receipts while he was an
attorney. At that time, Jason indicated he had other evidence including
evidence from his brother and his spouse.
[6]              
At this hearing, Jason filed an unsworn
statement  indicating that he was not aware that he had to maintain a record of
his spending and receipts.  The court allowed him to affirm his statement so
that it became evidence at the hearing. Jason was not able to provide a full
accounting of the monies spent from his mother’s account. No other evidence was
filed.
[7]              
For the reasons that follow, the court orders
Jason to repay the PGT on behalf of Loreen the amount of $247,284.22.
[8]              
The PGT Guardianship Investigation Unit (“GIU”)
was contacted by Loreen’s bank, Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”), in January 2023
alleging that Jason was financially abusing Loreen. The GIU investigated and
had reasonable grounds that Loreen was mentally incapable of handling her
property and she was at risk of harm.
[9]              
According to the Ottawa Hospital Geriatric
Outreach Team report by Linda Daly, Loreen moved in with Jason in 2016 and he
provided her with support including meeting her daily needs of laundry,
medication and financial management. Ms. Daly also found that Loreen had
trouble articulating concerns and providing details and required cuing from
Jason.
[10]          
On November 20, 2017 Jason told a home care
assessor, Kim Thompson, that Loreen was also repeating herself. Ms. Thompson
noted that Loreen was oriented to person, place, time and she knew her age.
[11]          
In 2018, Loreen was diagnosed with mixed
dementia (vascular disease, alcohol dementia and Alzheimer’s).
[12]          
On February 4, 2018, Loreen was deemed unfit to
drive a motor vehicle.
[13]          
According to the records of the Home and
Community Care Support Services (“HCCSS”), a provincial agency responsible for
coordinating admissions to publicly funded long-term care facilities and to
home support, Loreen was suffering cognitive decline since November 2017.  At
that time, Jason advised the coordinator that Loreen’s short-term memory had worsened
since 2014.
[14]          
Ms. Thompson completed another home care
assessment on February 26, 2019, and noted she was aware of her person, place
and time.
[15]          
By December 2020, the HCCSS records show that
Loreen was no longer oriented to place nor time.
[16]          
Loreen moved into the Bearbrook Retirement
Residence (Bearbrook) on November 4, 2020 (“Bearbrook”) and she was evicted on
December 31, 2022 due to non-payment of rent in the amount of $40,726.50.  She
was then moved to Garry J. Armstrong Home long-term care facility (Armstrong
LTC).  The private room was $2,336.92 per month and Jason authorized the City
of Ottawa to automatically withdraw that monthly fee. Jason was required to
deposit $200 into her long-term care trust account which could be used for her
private expenses such as grooming, dental care, activities, cabs.
[17]          
In December 2022, Jason had contacted HCSS to
arrange an urgent long-term care placement after she was evicted from her
retirement home, Bearbrook, and she was no longer mentally capable of
consenting to admission to long-term care. A behavioural assessment indicated
she was confused and unaware of her surroundings.
[18]          
The December 28, 2022 assessment of Loreen notes
that she did not know the date, location, what a long term care home was nor
why it was suggested that she live there. She showed little insight into her
daily needs but was able to complete tasks on cuing.
[19]          
The bank records and financial records filed
indicate that Jason spent $100,200 from January to August 2019 which included
the sale proceeds of Loreen’s condominium in Florida.
[20]          
The funds were withdrawn from her account by way
of cash withdrawals and purchases, including from men’s clothing stores, sports
supply stores and golf courses.
[21]          
Loreen’s bank, the RBC, was concerned and
restricted Jason’s access and required him to attend the bank in person to
complete transactions.
[22]          
From August 2019 to April 2023 he spent
approximately $202,000 by withdrawing cash or writing cheques to himself. The
account would often enter an overdraft status, causing numerous bank fees.
[23]          
In May 2023, the RBC restricted Jason’s ability
to withdraw cash or write cheques to himself.
[24]          
Despite these restrictions, Jason was able to
withdraw funds:
[25]          
In February 2024, the RBC paid Armstrong LTC
$14,300 to reduce Loreen’s rent arrears owed to this long-term care home to
$13,000.
[26]          
Loreen’s income is approximately $3,302.14 per
month from various pensions. She currently has arrears owing to the Armstrong
LTC.  Her monthly payment is $2,909.36. She owes the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
for taxes and PGT is paying CRA $100 per month towards these arrears.
[27]          
Despite permitting Jason time to provide an
accounting and receipts for the expenditures, he has failed to do so.  All the
banking records were filed and he has had many months to provide explanations
for the numerous withdrawals.
[28]          
From January 2019 to January 2024, the amount of
$301,997.50 was withdrawn.
[29]          
The PGT accepts Jason’s statement that $12,924
of the Visa was paid off of USD currency debt.
[30]          
The PGT accepts $33,000 for $1,500 per month for
22 months.  He would not be entitled to a caregiver allowance when Loreen was
in long term care.
[31]          
The PGT submits that Loreen was mentally
incapable of managing her property since January 1, 2019 or that Jason had
reasonable grounds to believe that Loreen was mentally incapable of managing
her property since at least January 2019.
[32]          
The PGT submits that the balance owing is
$256,067.50.
[33]          
Counsel met with Loreen and she does not oppose
the application and the money being sought and wanted to convey that she cares
for both of her sons.
[34]          
Counsel indicated that although Loreen has
difficulty speaking, she can answer direct questions with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and
she can engage and carry on her daily activities given time and patience.
[35]          
Throughout his communications with PGT, Jason attempted
to explain some of the expenditures.
[36]          
His affidavit filed confirms he took care of his
parents and played an important role in caring for his mother when her husband
(his father) passed away.
[37]          
He states he was not aware that he had to keep
records and receipts and provide for an accounting of the monies spent from his
mother’s account.
[38]          
His mother had told him to pay for items for his
family and it is his position that she was able to instruct him to do so as she
was capable of managing her property. In his submissions, Jason argued that his
mother was capable of providing instructions to him until at least 2023.
[39]          
For the reasons elaborated below, the court
finds that Jason owed his mother a fiduciary duty.
[40]          
Section 6 of the Substitute Decisions Act,
1992. S.O. 1992, c. 30, (“SDA”), defines the incapacity to manage
property as:
[41]          
The court is not prepared to find that Loreen
was incapable of managing her property as of January 1, 2019, as there is no
capacity assessment as of that date.
[42]          
Loreen has been experiencing cognitive decline
for several years.
[43]          
In 2016, Jason noticed Loreen’s memory cognition
decline and obtained a referral to Bruyere Hospital for Alzheimer’s disease and
dementia.
[44]          
Jason admitted that she was not capable when he
took over as attorney in May 2017, and the HCSS records reported issues of
cognition and short-term memory as far back as 2014.
[45]          
Yet, he also states that she was able to provide
him instructions regarding expenditures up to 2023.
[46]          
Based on the evidence before the court, the
court will not speculate as whether she was legally unable to manage her
financial affairs. The court cannot just make such a finding on the basis that
she had dementia which is a broad diagnosis and has many levels and degrees of
symptoms.
[47]          
However, a fiduciary relationship existed
between Jason and his mother.
[48]          
See Wedemire v. Wedemire 2017 ONSC 689s1
at paras. 51 to 54, where the court stated:
[49]          
In this case, Jason was in a fiduciary
relationship to Loreen for the entire period during which the transfers and
withdrawals described above took place.
[50]          
In accordance with the fiduciary definition
found in in Wedemire, the court finds that:
[51]          
Jason took over as an attorney for property in
May 2017 as he stated that, given her challenges, he needed to formally take
over the POA responsibilities.
[52]          
Accordingly, the court finds that Jason was in a
fiduciary relationship since May 2017.
[53]          
The court finds that Jason, as attorney for
property, was a fiduciary and his duties were to be exercised diligently, with
honesty and integrity and good faith.  He failed to do so.
[54]          
See s. 32(1) and s. 38(1) of the SDA. Section
38 of the SDA stipulates that an attorney for property owes the same
fiduciary duties as a guardian of property if the grantor is incapable of
managing property or if the attorney has reasonable grounds to believe that the
grantor is incapable of property.
[55]          
Further, a guardian of property has a duty to
account in accordance with s. 32(6),
[56]          
 He must exercise reasonable care as would a
reasonably prudent person managing her own affairs and not to act contrary to
the donor’s interests.  The SDA stipulates that the fiduciary must set
aside his own interests and act only in the donor’s interests.
[57]          
The court finds that Jason breached his
fiduciary obligation to Loreen in that he:
[58]          
Subject to the court’s findings with respect to the
two withdrawals to the City of Ottawa and certain cash Christmas gifts, he has
not provided any material evidence as required by section 14 of the Evidence
Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. E. 23, to corroborate the expenses.
[59]          
The PGT filed affidavits outlining the results
of their investigation by Lucie Payant.
[60]          
The investigation revealed the following:
[61]          
PGT relies on the bank statements filed from RBC
of Loreen and Jason from January 1, 2019 to September 2023.
[62]          
In his communications with the PGT and his
statements in these proceeding, Jason tried to explain some of the expenses.
However, he has failed to provide receipts and explain how they benefited his mother.
[63]          
He admitted at the hearing that he had breached
his fiduciary duty by not paying Bearbrook, although he was not content with
the care and complained about the bed bugs which resulted in  him discarding
many of his mother’s items when she was moved to Armstrong LTC.
[64]          
He apologized that he did not keep receipts, that
he was not aware that he had to do so as attorney and that no one had explained
it to him but admitted that “ignorance of the law is not an excuse”.
[65]          
He was concerned with respect to the position
articulated by Ms. Mamay, Loreen’s counsel, who stated that his mother was able
to communicate.
[66]          
Due to his criminal charges, he is restricted
from seeing his mother.  But he is aware that she is cognitively impaired and
cannot have a conversation with anyone and has no idea regarding finances.
[67]          
He cannot afford to repay the funds as he is
working at minimum wage and has to pay his criminal lawyer to defend him on the
charges brought against him as a result of these events.
[68]          
He apologized that he did not act in the “legal
way”.
[69]          
He told the PGT in his cover letter dated July
27, 2024 that Loreen gifted his wife $5,000 and $1,000 to his nieces.  There is
no corroborating evidence or documentary evidence to support this.
[70]          
The 56 pages of RBC account records were filed.
Jason explained 8 transactions such as a roof repair, loan payment gifts and
miscellaneous LTC payments without supporting documentation.
[71]          
He explained the following:
[72]          
Jason told the investigator that Loreen gifted
him and his brother $10,000 each and took the entire family for a trip.
[73]          
At the first hearing, he indicated that his
mother was a chronic alcoholic, a drug abuser and had to have cash in her
wallet at all time, minimum of $700. She would have 26 oz bottle every day or
1.5 days.
[74]          
With respect to his mother’s constant request
for alcohol, there is evidence that Jason told support services that she
stopped drinking in 2018, hence his explanation that some expenditures were for
alcohol are confirmed up to that date. (See Fareed v. Wood, 2005 CanLii
22134 and Ontario (Public Guardian & Trustee) v. Harkins, 2011
Carswell Ont 7097.) In the latter case, Justice Penny at para. 19 stated that
that the obligations of a fiduciary supersede the attorney’s own interests.
Citing Szarfer v. Chodos, 1986 CanLII 2508 (ON SC), that “One who
undertakes to act on behalf of another act for the exclusive benefit of that
other, putting his own interests completely aside”.
[75]          
In his 7-page affidavit for the hearing, he
confirmed that he needed to become his mother’s attorney in May 2017, and that
he had been mistreated by the Bearbrook Retirement Home, RBC and the Armstrong
LTC.  He confirmed his mother’s cognitive ability deteriorated in 2016 and he
was not able to maintain expenses due to the RBC's restriction to the
statements ( which are all before the court in evidence at this time).
[76]          
He bought items as required by his mother, his
niece and his family and took care of her.
[77]          
In his affidavit affirmed at the hearing, he
states:
[78]          
Jason submits that he was added to the joint
account which then superseded the POA and he helped his mother out and used the
money as she needed or for the home.
[79]          
The court permits the following payments to be
deducted from the original amount claimed by the PGT in its application.
[80]          
There is evidence of a payment of $1,500 per
month when the parents were residing with him.
[81]          
A letter dated August 1, 2014 states:
[82]          
The court finds that Jason has accounted for and
corroborated the amount of $1,500 per month for 22 months for a total of
$33,000.
[83]          
The court accepts the one payment in the amount
of $12,924 as a foreign exchange withdrawal regarding Loreen’s husband’s
medical fees while in Florida which is confirmed by a Visa statement.
[84]          
 Also, the court accepts the 2 withdrawals from
the bank to the City of Ottawa on April 3, 2023 for $2,769.14 marked “LTC” even
there is no receipt or documents, and another one for $2,814.14 on May 1, 2023
for LTC totalling $5,583.28. This amount will be deducted as it is a reasonable
inference that those monies were for the costs of the Armstrong LLC. The
amounts coincide with the cost of the long-term care home.
[85]          
The court will also permit the December 7, 2023 payment
of $1,000 for “Christmas Money
[86]          
Although there are no receipts for these gifts,
the court accepts his evidence that this money was directed to Loreen’s family
members for these special occasions. This totals $3200 that will be deducted
from the amount owing.
[87]          
The remainder of the expenses remain
uncorroborated, unconfirmed and undocumented.
[88]          
Jason was extensively involved in the care of
his mother but as an attorney, he had a duty to keep records of his spending
and ensure that her property was used for her benefit.
[89]          
As stated in Public Guardian and Trustee v.
Cherneyko et al., 2021 ONSC 107, at para. 51, “the failure to keep any
receipts for such a significant degree of expenditures evidences lack of skill,
diligence and good judgement on [the attorney’s] part”. He has had plenty of
time to gather his evidence and was given an adjournment to provide evidence.
[90]          
Jason also argues that as a joint account holder
he is able to withdraw monies as he deems fit. Jason provided an online RBC
pamphlet indicating that joint account holders share funds on the account and
can withdraw funds.
[91]          
However, there is a presumption of resulting
trust. That is, broadly speaking, a resulting trust arises whenever legal or
equitable title to property is in one party's name, but that party, because he
is a fiduciary or gave no value for the property, is under an obligation to
return it to the original title owner, or to the person. See Pecore v.
Pecore, 2007 SCC 17, at para. 20.
[92]          
In essence, this presumption also applies to
joint assets between parents and their independent adult children.
[93]          
As stated above, Jason as a joint account holder
does not have free rein to spend Loreen’s money as he wishes.  As a fiduciary,
he is in a fiduciary position and must be responsible to her for the accounting.
[94]          
The court finds that Jason has failed to account
and provide confirmation for $247,284. 22 of Loreen’s property.  His failure to
maintain receipts and proper accounting has put him in a position in this
proceeding that he is unable to account for these expenditures nor has he
demonstrated that these expenses benefited her.
[95]          
The court recognizes that any payment schedule
at this time will place a financial burden on Jason as he is working for
minimum wage.
[96]          
Nevertheless, Jason is responsible and he owes a
total of $247,284. 22 the PGT.  A payment plan can be entered into by the
parties.
[97]          
Given the success of the PGT and considering the
provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, and
having reviewed the bill of costs filed, the court orders costs in the amount
of  $5,000.00 in favour of the PGT.
