    "summary": "The Ebrahimi Parties sought to set aside previous court orders based on fraud and newly discovered evidence. PCCI's actions, including seeking a verdict in Iranian criminal proceedings, were inconsistent with obligations under a settlement agreement. The court found that the Minutes of Settlement were vitiated and void, and that PCCI was not entitled to enforcement under Canadian law."
