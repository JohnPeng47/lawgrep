[1]            This motion, commenced by the Defendant Jose Ramos to set aside the Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice De Sa dated September 21, 2021, came before me for hearing on December 9, 2024.
[2]            The facts related to the within motion are summarized in the respective factums of the parties, filed on the motion, and are otherwise found within the motion records filed by the parties.
[3]            The following is a summary of the key facts that I found assistive in determining this motion:
[4]            Rule 19.08(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”) allows a judge to set aside a judgment against a defendant who has been noted in default that is obtained on a motion for judgment “on such terms as are just”.
[5]            The test to set aside a default judgment is set out in the Court of Appeal decision Mountain View Farms Ltd. v. McQueen, 2014 ONCA 194, 119 O.R. (3d) 561:
[6]            The potential prejudice to each of the parties must be considered as well as the effect of any order made on the overall integrity of the administration of justice.
[7]            Similar to r. 19.08(2), r. 37.14(1) of the Rules allows a party who is affected by an order obtained on a motion without notice or who fails to appear on a motion through accident, mistake, or insufficient notice; or is affected by an order of a registrar to move to set aside the order, by notice of motion served forthwith after the order comes to the person’s attention and names the first available date that is at least three (3) days after service of the notice of motion. Similar to r. 19.08(2), the court may set aside or vary an order on such terms as are just.
[8]            The test to set aside an order under r. 37.14(1) is set out in Ontario (Attorney General) v. 15 Johnswood Crescent, 2009 CanLII 50751 (On. Sup. Ct.). The rule’s purpose is focused on fairness and the understanding that civil proceedings should be determined on their merits.
[9]            The court should strive to resolve issues between litigants on the merits whenever this can be done with fairness to the parties: see Bank of Montreal v. Saidani, 2023 ONSC 4216.
[10]            Further, as noted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Zeifman Partners Inc. v. Aiello, 2020 ONCA 33, the overarching principle of the Rules is to seek to ensure the “just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits...Determining the result of civil proceedings on technical failings is, and must remain, the exception to the general principle reflected in Rule 1.04(1)”.
[11]            In the present case, the Defendant Ramos claims that he did not receive any documents served upon him following service of his Notice of Intent to Act in Person served on March 13, 2018.
[12]            Having reviewed the evidence filed, including the numerous affidavits of service, I find as follows:
[13]            I find it most likely that Ramos did not receive a copy of the Notice of Motion to strike his Statement of Defence served at the 68 Findlay Avenue in February of 2019, and as such Ramos was not provided with actual notice of the motion.
[14]            I also find that although it was Ramos’ responsibility to update his address for service – which he did not do – the Plaintiff bears some responsibility for repeatedly serving Ramos by ordinary mail at an address that elicited no response.
[15]            In my view, it is contrary to the administration of justice and the integrity of the judicial system to allow the extremely serious allegations against Ramos to be determined by default, and not upon the merits of the case.
[16]            I accept Ramos’ evidence that he moved promptly when he learned that the Plaintiff had obtained default judgment against him. I also accept that Ramos’ (new) counsel moved expeditiously to bring the motion to set aside the default judgment.
[17]            Ramos claims that he did not attend the examinations and timetable motion because he did not receive notice of the events.
[18]            As noted, I have difficulty accepting Ramos’ explanation that he did not receive notice of any proceedings. In my view, it appears probable that on March 13, 2018, when he filed his Notice of Intent to Act in Person, he believed (as he stated) that the litigation was stagnant. It had been almost six (6) years since the incident that forms the basis of the Claim occurred (Sept. 13, 2012) and no further steps had been taken by the Plaintiff.
[19]            Despite Ramos’ statements to the contrary, it appears that, following March 13, 2018, Ramos ignored the litigation with the expectation that the claim would be dismissed. This, however, is not what occurred.
[20]            Ramos’ explanation for the default is that he did not receive notice of the proceedings, was self-represented, and did not know his responsibilities.
[21]            As noted above, I do not accept that he did not receive notice of the proceedings prior to November 1, 2019. I also accept that he did not receive any notice of the motion to strike his pleadings as he had moved by the date of service of the motion. Further, while Ramos is responsible for his failure to update his address, the Plaintiff must have been alert to the probability that there was an issue with service upon Ramos by this date and bears partial responsibility for proceeding to judgment without having verified Ramos’ current address and without ensuring that Ramos had actual notice of the default proceedings.
[22]            There are two issues to be determined in the action: liability and damages.
[23]            To show a defence on the merits, a defendant must only show that his defence has an air of reality, which is a low threshold.
[24]            Ramos has denied the allegations against him and filed a Statement of Defence. In separate but related proceedings, Ramos hired a criminal defence lawyer and the charges were withdrawn by the Crown. Ramos also hired a lawyer to defend the HRTO application, which proceeding was determined to be barred due to the commencement of the civil proceeding.
[25]            As would be apparent to the Plaintiff in both the criminal and the civil proceeding, Ramos, by word and deed, sought to defend the action on its merits. Given the seriousness of the allegations and the social, quasi-criminal, and family stigma that is attached to any finding of guilt with respect to the allegations, it is only just that Ramos be provided with an opportunity to defend the action on its merits.
[26]            With respect to the quantum of damages awarded, a defendant is entitled to challenge damages claimed, which can constitute a defence on the merits. This is especially true in situations such as the present, where the plaintiff has sought and obtained damages relating to the same or similar fact pattern from the Criminal Compensation Board and/or the Arista Home Defendants. These settlements and information may be material to any damages payable by Ramos.
[27]            As noted, Ramos has been ordered to pay approximately $500,000.00 (including interest) to the Plaintiff on account of damages.
[28]            The direct financial prejudice that would suffered if the judgment is not set aside is great. However, financial prejudice represents only a portion of the actual prejudice that would be visited upon Ramos as the judgment is based upon an underlying finding of fact that Ramos committed sexual assault and battery. The prejudice that could or would be suffered by Ramos on account of this underlying finding of fact will remain tied to Ramos for his lifetime with potentially devastating prejudice.
[29]            With respect to any prejudice suffered by the Plaintiff, while it is true that she will be required to undergo cross-examination and/or a trial, such hardships are necessary to ensure the integrity of the administration of justice. Any other prejudice may be compensated financially.
[30]            The administration of justice must not be silenced to ease the burden of civil litigation.
[31]            For the foregoing reasons, Ramos’ motion is granted and determined as follows:
