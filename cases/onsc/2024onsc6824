Drawing inspiration from two mid-nineteenth
century cases which spanned a generation, Charles Dickens serialized Bleak
House, a novel about the interminable, and fictional, case of Jaryndyce v.
Jaryndyce. Although several decades less than that weary case, the matter
before this court has dragged on for almost two decades. The parties’ four
children, ranging from twelve to twenty-three years of age when their parents
separated, are now financially independent adults with successful, two with professional,
careers. Not surprisingly (perhaps) for protracted family law proceedings, the
children are divided in their loyalties and estranged from at least one of their
parents, who will be described as “the wife” and “the husband” for ease of
reference even though they were divorced on June 30, 2018.
[2]              
The trial evidence consists of affidavits from
the parties and their witnesses, supplemented by time-limited direct
examination and cross-examination. In addition to the parties, the court heard
from the wife’s brother (Hessam Korhani), one of the parties’ sons (Masoud Sahebolamri,
with whom the husband has lived since the parties separated) and Fahad Rehman
(a real estate broker who provided expert evidence on residential rental values).
[3]              
The issues to be determined involve:
[4]              
Pursuant to Minutes of Settlement dated May 5,
2023, the parties agreed to settle the wife’s child support claim for $75,000,
comprising $45,000 for table child support and $30,000. for post-secondary
expenses. This amount is to be paid from the husband’s share of the net
proceeds of sale from the matrimonial home (see below).
[5]              
Although a Maher was identified as an issue for
trial in the Trial Scheduling Order dated April 24, 202[3] (sic) the
wife withdrew that claim in her third amendment to her application on April 23,
2023. No evidence was led at trial by either party involving the Maher.
[6]              
The parties agreed to abandon any claims
involving spousal support.
[7]              
Ancillary to the trial issues (as it was not an
issue identified for trial), the parties disputed the wife’s efforts to comply
with Orders made for the sale of the matrimonial home. The property was finally
sold in 2023 for about $148,000 less than a better offer- the husband claims that
the wife should be held accountable for this loss. As of the date of this
Decision, the sale transaction has not closed. This issue will be addressed when
determining each party’s entitlement to post-separation adjustments.
[8]              
The parties filed a Statement of Agreed Facts (“SAF”)
that they signed on the morning that the trial started. Most of the agreed
facts, those unchallenged by the parties and other procedural events relevant
to the issues in this case are set out below or are elsewhere referenced (where
appropriate) in this Decision:
[9]              
Each party challenged the credibility of the
other party. Neither was wholly credible, but for mostly different reasons. For
example, the wife submitted that the husband’s evidence about his net worth on
the marriage date should not be accepted or believed because he was unable to
independently support his testimony with documentary evidence. As for the
husband, he alleged a scheme, or plan, by the wife and her family to do
whatever it took to obtain sole ownership of the matrimonial home, which is
what happened ultimately.
[10]          
As has been frequently observed, the assessment
of witness credibility is an inexact science, impossible to articulate with
precision. For example, a witness may be so interested in a case that they are
incapable of making an admission, or facilitating the disclosure of information
that they perceive as helpful to the other party and harmful to their case. Or
a witness may impress the court with the logic, or common sense, of their
narrative but be unreliable due to the absence of probative, independent
information or their interest in the outcome of the case. These affect the
weight to be given to that evidence. There is, quite simply, no
one-size-fits-all template. Several of the many considerations relevant to the
weighing and assessment of witness credibility and reliability, and relevant to
his case, were comprehensively reviewed in Al-Sajee v. Tawfic[6] by
Chappel J. who aptly observed that,
[11]          
In this case the wife is less credible than the
husband. His evidence was slightly more credible but less reliable. These are
some of the reasons:
[12]          
In many respects, the parties (especially the
wife) tailored their evidence to support their preferred narrative. In the
husband’s case his credibility was adversely impacted by “omission”; that is,
failing to tender evidence which could have supported his case. Accordingly, in
assessing the components of each party’s family property, greater weight will
be given to evidence of an independent character such as a document, linking documents
to each party’s narrative and applying (with caution) common sense to fill in
any evidentiary gaps.
[13]          
Pursuant to s. 5(1) of the Family Law Act[8] (“the
Act”) spousal parties must share the value of any difference
in their net worth when their marriage breaks down, subject to certain
deductions or exclusions. In this case, each party has claimed that the value
of some of their property should be deducted or excluded from the calculation
of their net family property.
[14]          
Sections 4(1) of the Act identifies what is, and
what is not, included in the calculation:
[15]          
The wife’s trial financial statement and her net
family property statement inconsistently recorded her net family property. It
was $990,660 in her financial statement (sworn May 9, 2023) and $1,108,484 in
her net family property statement (dated May 26, 2023). No effort was made at trial
to reconcile the difference. The husband’s corresponding statements both
recorded “Nil” as his net family property (each dated May 9, 2023). The wife
claimed that the husband owed her (as already noted) an equalization payment of
$25,758. The husband claimed that he was owed an equalization payment of
$852,920.50 but submitted a proposed final Order seeking a $400,000
equalization payment, a difference that, as with the wife, was never reconciled
whether during the trial or when the parties made their written submissions. They
did not prepare and file a combined net family property statement despite being
ordered to do so by the Trial Scheduling Order.
[16]          
Title to the matrimonial home was held in the
joint names of the parties. Each declared a different gross value for the
property. The wife used a current value whereas the husband used a much lesser
value, likely more reflective of the home’s value on the valuation date. In neither
case were appraisals tendered as evidence. None was needed anyway as there is
no impact on the ultimate determination of the equalization payment.
[17]          
The wife’s net family property statement
included nothing for the husband’s Iranian properties or for their values which
the husband declared that he owned on the valuation date. The wife chose not to
cross-examine the husband on any of the properties or their values as of the
valuation date. The court will accept the husband’s evidence.
[18]          
There are several items in dispute.
[19]          
The wife claimed that the furniture in the home
was worth $5,000. Presumably that included the husband’s $3,000 estimate for
the value of furniture, kitchenware, carvings and books which he recorded as
being acquired before marriage. He also claimed that, in addition to the value
of the items he brought to the marriage, the household contents (not including
rugs) were worth $20,450. He testified that he had been unable to retrieve any
of his belongings from the home, no furniture and no rugs, although there was
no evidence that he ever made meaningful efforts in that regard.
[20]          
The wife claimed that the value of the rugs in
the home was “Nil”. While she acknowledged that there were rugs in the home,
she testified that she had no idea about their value. The husband alleged they
were worth $200,000.
[21]          
The evidence is unchallenged that the wife
retained the entirety of the contents of the matrimonial home. There was no
independent evidence appraising the value of the household contents and the
rugs nor any evidence about either party’s efforts to identify the value of either
group.
[22]          
The husband’s unchallenged evidence is that
there had been a fire at the matrimonial home on January 26, 2002, that caused
smoke-related damage to the home and its’ contents, including damage to what
the husband described were “many expensive Persian carpets”. An insurance payment
was made to the parties for many of the rugs but not for the silk rugs and
other rugs which were either hand-woven or which carpeted stairs in the home. There
was no evidence about the purchase cost for any of these rugs. Any such records
were left in the home. There was no evidence that the husband had made any
effort to contact the insurance companies (there were two involved) after the
parties separated. There were no appraisals. The husband produced a list of the
damaged rugs/carpets. He also produced a letter from a rug dealership dated
October 16, 2002 (Thorn Hill Rugs) that suggested that the fire damage had
devalued the rugs about $40,000 from their original values and which proposed
to replace and/or provide related remediation services for $36,000.
[23]          
Given the frailty of the evidence about the composition
and associated value of the household contents, the best this court can do is
average the values proposed by the parties (with the exception of the husband’s
$3,000 estimate for chattels over twenty-four years old which he claimed were
worth that amount on the date of marriage). Accordingly, there will be
attributed to the wife a $25,450 value for household contents (i.e., $5,000
plus $20,450). As observed by Kiteley J. in Shaw v. Shaw[9] “the
calculation of net family property is not an exact science.”
[24]          
Given the nature of the wife’s family business,
which specializes in high quality rugs marketed nationally and internationally
and her position as a director and shareholder, I cannot accept that the rugs
in the home had no value as she claimed. She is not credible on that issue. She
never addressed the husband’s allegations of value apart from a blanket denial.
Despite the absence of a more robust effort by the husband to prove the value that
he attributed to the rugs ($200,000), I am prepared to accept that, as a
minimum, the home had, and the wife has retained, at least $36,000 in value for
them, the cost of remediation.
[25]          
There will be added to the wife’s column under
this category $61,450 representing the value of the contents of the matrimonial
home ($25,450) and the value of the rugs ($36,000).
[26]          
The parties disputed whether the wife owned an
automobile on the valuation date. No effort was made to verify whether the wife
had use of an automobile, who owned it if she did and, if she was the owner,
its value. The wife testified that the automobile was owned by her father but
was not pressed on that issue by the husband. No automobile value will be
attributed to the wife.
[27]          
The husband claims that he is entitled to deduct
the net value of the $3,801,500 in property that he owned when the parties
married.
[28]          
The wife claims that the value of her shares in the
Korhani Group worth $843,776 should be excluded from her net family property
calculation pursuant to s. 4(2) of the Act because she acquired them by gift
from her late father before the valuation date. The subsections relevant
to this case are the following:
[29]          
Section 4(3) of the Act provides that the evidentiary
burden “of proving a deduction under the definition of “net family property” or
an exclusion under subsection (2) is on the person claiming it.
[30]          
Each of the parties’ claims will be separately
addressed.
[31]          
The wife claims that when the parties separated,
irrespective of their preferred valuation date, the parties owed her mother
$165,000. This was paid on June 15, 2004, in three separate cheques drawn on
the parties’ joint line of credit. In her trial financial statement, the wife
identified a $100,000 line of credit debt owing on her valuation date.[10] In
addition to the debt, the wife seeks a post-valuation date adjustment of $87,930.42
in her favour representing one-half of the interest paid on the line of credit
after September 4, 2004.
[32]          
The husband denied that anything was owed to his
mother-in-law and that the funds were withdrawn without notice to him. He
claimed that access to the line of credit was frozen (on or about September 7,
2004) because of the wife’s contact with the bank; it would only allow deposits.
He submitted that he should not be held responsible for either the debt owed on
the valuation date or for the interest paid afterwards. In the financial
statements (four) that he filed between October 14, 2005, and September 1, 2006,
the husband recorded that he owed $700 on the line of credit on May 1, 2004,
being his one-half share of $1,400. Each of these financial statements also
recorded the same value despite their separate dates over an eleven-month
period. The husband’s May 9, 2023, trial financial statement recorded his share
of the debt at $726 on May 1, 2004, and $103,109 on the date that statement was
sworn, implying that the outstanding amount owed was $206,218. The husband
acknowledged that he never made any payments on the line of credit balance after
September 4, 2004, and paid none of the interest charged on the outstanding
balance either.
[33]          
The evidence, much of it from the husband’s
trial testimony, supports the wife’s claims. This is the evidence:
[34]          
The documentary evidence comprising of records
in the husband’s handwriting, the corresponding (and, in my view,
corroborating) account statements and the overall consistency of the wife’s
evidence with them all point to the parties owing $165,300 to the wife’s mother
as of May 1, 2004, the husband’s choice of valuation date. The husband’s position
that nothing was owed to his mother-in-law is inconsistent with the records he
maintained and while there are some inconsistencies in the wife’s evidence (i.e.,
the date of repayment) they are insufficient to undermine her claim on a
balance of probabilities.
[35]          
There is no account statement in evidence about
the balance owed as of September 4, 2004. What is known, and what this court
accepts, is that from and after that date only interest on the outstanding
balance owed was paid by the wife. The first statement after September 4, 2004,
that the wife was able to obtain from the bank was dated February 1, 2011, and
showed a balance of $206,202.19 and, with minor exceptions, the balance never
varied afterward.
[36]          
The court will accept that the balance owing on
the line of credit as of September 4, 2004, was $206,202.
[37]          
The husband claimed that the net value of his
property (no debts or other liabilities) on the date of marriage was
$3,801,500. Several distinct kinds of property were, and remain, involved. The
husband claimed that he owned realty in Iran comprising six properties worth
$3,255,000 (one having twelve parcels), general household items and vehicles
($35,000, estimated, including a 50% interest in assorted rugs for which no
value was attributed[14]),
bank accounts and other savings ($7,500- estimated) and money owed to him
($504,000 by members of the wife’s family and by his two brothers). In his
trial financial statement sworn on May 9, 2023, the husband retained ownership
of four of the lands owned on the marriage date and a smaller portion of the
much larger group of the twelve parcels owned on the marriage date. He
estimated the aggregate value of his realty on the valuation date was $193,663.
[38]          
In his trial affidavit, the husband stated (at
para. 43) that he had not been able to retrieve any of his documents or written
correspondence with a deceased brother after he was charged and unable to
return to the matrimonial home in September 2004. He also stated (at para. 88)
that:
[39]          
The wife’s evidence was that she was unaware
about what, if any, property was owned by the husband on the marriage date.
[40]          
In cross-examination, the husband testified to
the following:
[41]          
The foregoing observations apply equally to the
husband’s claims relating to general household items and vehicles, and his bank
accounts and savings. As for the $504,000 claimed for money owed, $430,000 USD represented
a “bad debt” (in parentheses)[15]
owed by the wife’s family, $44,000 from a brother (Hassan) and $30,000 from a
deceased brother (Hussein).
[42]          
With respect to the $430,000 USD owed, the
husband testified that he used his own savings and had borrowed “here and
there” from friends and family to loan to the wife’s family before the parties
married. No supporting, documentary evidence was tendered confirming the dates
or amounts of the borrowed funds or their receipt and, despite two of the
lenders (his brother and a friend) being alive at the time of trial, neither
was called to testify nor was any explanation given for their unavailability. In
none of the husband’s four financial statements sworn between October 14, 2005,
to September 1, 2006, did the husband make any reference to money owed to him
by either the wife’s family or the Korhani Group. Moreover, he testified that
there was an ongoing lawsuit in Iran between him and the Korhani Group for
$830,000 USD owed to him of which the $430,000 USD was included. The husband’s
evidence was that he was in possession of a $830,000 USD cheque purportedly
from the Korhani Group dated February 15, 1985, drawn on a bank in Iran which
he had been unable to negotiate due to insufficient funds. The husband had been
convicted of fraud relating to that cheque but was later acquitted by a
Provincial Court of Appeals in Iran in July 2013. Counsel never addressed how
that case impacted this case (except for credibility purposes).
[43]          
In his trial financial statement, the husband
claimed that he had no business interests on the marriage date. In his trial
Net Family Property Statement of the same date the husband declared that he had
business interests totalling $830,000 on the marriage date, roughly
corresponding to the wife’s shares in the Korhani Group. Hassan Korhani
testified that the husband had never provided any money to, or had invested in,
the Korhani Group.
[44]          
No documentary evidence was tendered with
respect to either of the loans alleged to have been made to the husband by his
brothers. The debt owed by Hassan was repaid before the valuation date but
there was no evidence when that was paid or where the funds were deposited. As
for Hussein’s debt, it was never repaid.
[45]          
Despite the absence of documentary evidence
probative of his net worth on the marriage date, the husband’s evidence was
that, following the wife and children, he landed in Canada in 1987 having
qualified as a businessman under the Canada immigrant entrepreneur program. In his
application for a permanent residence permit dated August 4, 1986, the husband
declared that he had $500,000 cash and $200,000 in real estate which he said at
trial had been invested in the Korhani Group. There was no evidence how or
where these funds were held, the date or dates when any of them was invested or
any acknowledgement of their investment. There was no evidence about what comprised
the real estate investment. There was no evidence, for example, of efforts to
explore (or obtain disclosure of) any of the Korhani Group corporate records.
[46]          
Based on the husband’s evidence and the
inconsistencies in his affidavit/financial statements and testimony, there is
considerable doubt about the identity and value of his assets on the marriage
date. There are no valuations. There is no evidence of associated debts or
other liabilities, contingent or otherwise. There is no reasonable explanation
why evidence of potentially corroborative witnesses (like the husband’s surviving
siblings or his friend) was not tendered. The husband submitted that the court
should accept his personal view of his assets at the marriage date and the
amount of his investment in Canada as constituting “the plausible range such a
valuation may take”.
[47]          
I am unable to accept this approach. In many
cases, proving a deduction is not an issue. But in cases where there is an
absence of documentary or other credible evidence due to the passage of time
(like this case), the destruction or suppression of evidence (suggested in this
case) or inaccessibility to third-party information (such as banking records
over seven years old, obvious in this case too), a party must adopt an approach
not dissimilar to tracing an exclusion, the difference being that tracing is a
prospective rather than retrospective method (or tool).[16] Proving
a deduction requires a retrospective “but for” approach that looks for evidence
or circumstances probative of assets and their net value proximate to the
marriage date. A common sense and reasonable view must be taken of the evidence;
a sufficient link must be found. In this case, the husband’s evidence about the
identity and value of his deductions and his efforts to verify and value them fall
far short of discharging his statutory burden of proving them on a balance of
probabilities.
[48]          
No deduction shall be allowed for the value of
the husband’s assets alleged to have been owned on the marriage date.
[49]          
The wife claimed that she owned various series
of shares in three companies of the Korhani Group collectively worth $843,776
on the valuation date. Her evidence was that these had been gifted to her in
1995 by her father and so their value should be excluded from her net family
property. He died on February 29, 2016. No expert evidence was tendered with
respect to the value of any of the companies, the value of the wife’s shares or
any contingent tax liabilities. The wife obtained the values from her brother
(Hessam). He was the owner of two of the three companies comprising the Korhani
Group in which the wife held shares and he was the owner of another Korhani
company that employed the husband on the valuation date. His evidence was that
his father had gifted the shares to the wife.
[50]          
The wife tendered in evidence three Declarations
each dated December 10, 2015, which she said had been signed by her father. The
Declarations were identically worded and stated that he (i.e., her father) had
gifted the shares to her. Each document had a different witness. The wife
testified that she had been present when each Declaration was signed; two had
been signed at her father’s home and the third at the office of her trial
counsel.
[51]          
The husband agreed with the value attributed to
the wife’s shares but submitted that it was his “belief” that the shares were given
to her as repayment for the funds that he had advanced to his brothers-in-law
and, consequently, they were “provided to the parties jointly or as part of a
joint family undertaking”. The wife was not entitled to her exclusion. I am
unable to accept this submission and am satisfied that the wife has led
sufficient evidence to prove that the shares from her father were a gift for
these reasons:
[52]          
The wife is entitled to exclude $843,776 from
the calculation of her net family property.
[53]          
A Net Family Property statement accompanies and
forms part of this Decision. The husband owes the wife an equalization payment
of $19,028.
[54]          
The wife has claimed for $253,561.80 in
post-separation adjustments from the husband representing his one-share of the
following expenses (the amount claimed is in brackets): CIBC line of credit
($87,930.42); mortgage expenses ($36,425); property taxes ($78,553.50); home
insurance ($18,828.20); and repairs to the matrimonial home ($31,824.68).[17] In his
closing submissions and the draft final Order that he proposed, the husband
acknowledged owing $5,000 on the line of credit, $35,000 for the discharge of
the mortgage (but nothing for the principal and interest payments made after
September 1, 2004), he agreed about his share of the property taxes and the
home insurance but disputed whether he should be held responsible for any
repairs to the matrimonial home. The aggregate difference is $151,180.[18]
[55]          
The wife claimed, and the husband admitted, that
he paid nothing on the line of credit after September 4, 2004. As of April 25,
2023, the wife calculated that she had paid $175,860.84 in interest. In support
of her claim the wife tendered a letter dated September 24, 2018, from the CIBC
addressed to the husband that advised that the interest paid on the line of
credit from January 1, 2004, to September 24, 2018, was $124,391.59. The
husband did not challenge this figure. Accompanying the wife’s affidavit (Exhibit
B) were a series of interest only payments from January 31, 2018, to April 25,
2023. Those from and after September 2018 total $41,991.55.[19] The
total interest paid from January 1, 2004, to April 25, 2023, is $166,383,
rounded. The only evidence about interest payments on the line of credit before
September 4, 2004, are the April and June 2004 account statements which
averaged about $300 a month. Accepting that amount for the first eight months
of 2004 would reduce the interest paid after September 4, 2004, to $163,393
(i.e., $166,383 less [8 x $300]).
[56]          
For the twelve months ending in April 2023, the
average monthly interest payment was $950, rounded.
[57]          
The wife’s evidence is that she paid $72,850 in
principal and interest on the matrimonial home mortgage between December 31,
2004 (when its principal was $36,850.26) and its discharge in 2018. A 2004
Annual Mortgage Statement disclosed that a total of $2,135.87 in interest was
paid in 2004. The mortgage was a five-year closed mortgage with a December 31, 2004,
interest rate of 4%.
[58]          
The husband did not dispute the principal shown
as owing on the December 31, 2004, mortgage statement. He is responsible for
one-half of that amount (i.e., $18,425.13) which the court will increase to $18,643,
say $18,640 rounded, representing an estimate as to the principal paid on the
mortgage by the wife from September 4, 2004, to December 31, 2004.[20] This
figure will be included in calculating the net family property calculation.
[59]          
As for the interest paid on the mortgage
principal, the wife’s evidence was that she was unable to obtain mortgage
statements for each year after 2004 until 2017, when the total interest paid in
that year was $262.22. The 2017 mortgage statement indicated a five-year open
mortgage with a variable rate of interest ranging from 3% (January 1, 2017) to
4.2% (December 31, 2017). The wife calculated that she had paid “about $3,000
in interest annually from 2005 to 2017, or about $36,000.”[21] I am
unable to accept this evidence; the math makes no sense. The monthly mortgage
cost would have comprised principal and interest with the allocation between those
two amounts varying monthly as each payment was made. The monthly principal
repaid would increase, and the interest component would form a smaller part of
each payment.
[60]          
The wife provided no evidence about renewals of
the mortgage, whether the renewals had variable or fixed interest rates or even
the relevant rates although these details could have been obtained from tendering
copies of the mortgage instruments from the property abstract. Absent any
better evidence, the court will average the annual interest, taking the
December 31, 2004, amount paid ($2,135.87) and the December 31, 2017, amount
paid ($262.22) totalling $2,389, divided in half ($1,199) and multiplied by the
thirteen years captured by the two statements, thereby resulting in total
interest paid of $15,587.
[61]          
There was no evidence when the mortgage was
discharged in 2018, nor the interest paid in 2018 to that date. Assuming that
the mortgage was discharged in mid-June 2018, then about another $115 interest
would have been paid. Adding that to $15,587 would result in a total interest
paid figure of $15,602, or $15,600 rounded. The husband is liable for one-half
of that amount or $7,800. The wife is entitled to an adjustment in this
amount from the husband’s share of the sale proceeds.
[62]          
The wife submitted maintenance and repair bills for
the matrimonial home for two periods, one from September 4, 2004, to 2017
($35,353) and the other for the period from 2018 to 2023 ($16,876.90) and
claimed that the husband should be ordered to contribute to one-half of their
total cost. The husband acknowledged that he owed something to the wife for household
expenses but declined to identify for the court what those comprised or their
amount, submitting baldly that he should only be obliged to reimburse the wife
for those expenses which she could prove were paid by her. He pointed out that
many of the bills did not indicate the address of the matrimonial home or were
not addressed to the wife.
[63]          
So, without either party’s assistance, the court
took a deeper dive into the evidence.
[64]          
Exhibit J to the wife’s affidavit comprised
receipts and the invoices for the repairs that the wife said she paid for the
matrimonial home for the period ending in 2017 ($35,353). There are many
problems with the wife’s evidence. For example, a May 20, 2010, receipt for
$6,530 (although the amount is almost unintelligible) identified the client as
Korhani of Canada Inc. Another, for plumbing (2012), had no customer identified
or service address. So too the invoices dated for 2014 and 2015 from Rubik Construction
totalling $16,608.67 were all addressed to the Korhani Group business offices
and gave no indication where or for whom, other than at the Korhani Group
address, the invoiced work was performed. Several invoices which did identify
the wife as the customer and the matrimonial home address (such as Arya Design
Inc. in 2011 and 2013) described wear and tear maintenance work (i.e., supplying
and installing a kitchen light, painting a dining table and two other small
tables, etc.). A 2017 invoice was for the installation and supply of a new air
conditioner. If the Korhani Group paid for these expenses, or if the wife paid
for them, there is no record of their payment being recorded in any shareholder
account ledger for the wife or proof (such as a bank account statement) that
the wife paid the bill. She was able, for example, to provide monthly
statements for the joint credit line extending as far back as 2011.
[65]          
Given this court’s concerns about the wife’s
credibility, the fact that she had exclusive possession of the matrimonial home
for almost twenty years, the invoices in many instances recording maintenance work
(or what may be described as “wear and tear” work) and the absence of any
evidence that the husband was ever consulted about any of the expenses before
they were incurred (even if he could afford them, which this court doubts) I am
not inclined to award her anything on account of her larger claim for the
period prior to 2018.
[66]          
The evidence with respect to the household
expenses after 2017 (i.e., $16,876.90) as set out in Exhibit F is marginally
more persuasive. This includes removal of a damaged tree (2018), washroom repairs
and exterior lighting replacement and garage painting (2021), heating and
cooling maintenance (2021), and a fence repair (2022). Of these, I will only
accept the tree removal ($2,100 cash) invoice, repairs to four washrooms in
August 2021 ($3,955) and fence repair in 2022 ($475),[22] the
latter two times when the home had been ordered to be sold. The other bills (to
replace a kitchen faucet and what appear to be air conditioning service calls-the
descriptions for the work performed and the repair codes are unintelligible)
will not be considered as they represent ordinary expenses that an occupant
would reasonably be expected to incur for their sole benefit.
[67]          
Accordingly, the wife will be allowed the sum of
$3,265 for this category (i.e., $6,530/2).
[68]          
The husband submits that the wife owes him an equalization
payment ranging between $304,000 (if calculated from September 2010) to
$165,000 (if calculated from November 2017) although his proposed final Order
seeks $200,000. The wife disagrees and submits that no occupation rent should
be ordered.
[69]          
Occupation rent is a discretionary remedy that
can be used to ensure financial fairness between spouses.[23] It is a
tool for balancing competing equities.[24]
The Order must be reasonable; it need not be exceptional.[25] In Griffiths
v. Zambosco[26],
the Court of Appeal identified a number of relevant factors which the Court in Chhom
acknowledged as consistently taken into account when making this determination,
those being: the timing of the claim for occupation rent; the duration of the
occupancy; the inability of the non-resident spouse to realize their equity in
the property; any reasonable credits to be set off against occupation rent; and
any other competing claims in the litigation.[27]
[70]          
In Saroli, Petersen J. added other
factors:
[71]          
The list of relevant factors is not restricted. No
factor predominates. The circumstances to be considered will vary from case to
case.
[72]          
Fahad Rehman is a real estate agent and broker.
He was retained by the husband to provide an opinion about the range of rental
values for the matrimonial home from September 2014 to April 2023. Mr. Rahman is
not a Certified Residential Appraiser (“CRA”) nor does he have an accredited
appraiser designation sanctioned by the Accredited Appraisal Canadian Institute
(“AACI”). He was not asked by the husband to provide an opinion about the market
value of the property, only what the historical data reported were rental
values for comparable properties. Forty-four properties over a nine-year time
span were reviewed.
[73]          
The threshold requirements for expert evidence
admissibility are set out in R. v. Mohan[29]
(relevance, necessity, absence of an exclusionary rule and a properly qualified
expert). The wife challenged Mr. Rahman’s expert qualifications, specifically the
absence of CRA and AACI designations. He testified that he used a Sales
Comparison Approach for those properties where lease information was provided,
and he adjusted the presumptive rental rate for the property according to data
point differences between the subject property and leased properties. He spoke
clearly and was candid about the limitations of his retainer, his training and
qualifications. He was an active realtor. In my view, his evidence was
relevant, necessary, there was no applicable exclusionary rule, and the absence
of the CRA and AACI designations did not, in my view, disqualify him from providing
the court with an opinion about rental rates. Accordingly, he was qualified to
give expert opinion evidence about the rental value of the matrimonial home for
the years reviewed based on published data.
[74]          
Mr. Rahman testified that he had not physically
inspected the interior of the property or any other structures on the property
but had had the benefit of its’ description and photographs from the property’s
MLS listing. The publicly available market data and other information available
to realtors framed his analysis, which was restricted to the area in which the
matrimonial home was situated. Two filters were used. One filter (“the broader
filter”) involved all properties in the South Richvale area (where the home was
located); the other filter (“the weighted filter”[30]), one to
which Mr. Rahman said he gave added weight, involved homes in the 3500 to 5000
square foot (“sf”) range. The matrimonial home was in the 4000sf range.
[75]          
All the properties reviewed were compared on
metrics such as size (where disclosed), finishes, lot size, unique qualities,
room sizes, status/finish level of basement and location. In many cases, the
data reviewed did not have the 3500 to 5000sf filter so Mr. Rahman used the
broader filter. This meant that for some years (2015, 2017 and 2019) there were
no rentals in the weighted filter range corresponding to the matrimonial home
but there were rentals using the broader filter. In 2023, nine properties reported
rental rates but only two disclosed their sf and each of those had sf less than
the matrimonial home. There was no sf given for the other seven properties
listed.
[76]          
In Mr. Rahman’s opinion the data indicated that
the matrimonial home would have achieved the following monthly rental rates for
the following years:
[77]          
Mr. Rahman was a credible witness. He stayed “in
his lane” with respect to what the data disclosed and drew upon his realtor
experience. I accept his opinions about the rental values for the matrimonial
home for the years reviewed.
[78]          
 The wife called no expert evidence.
[79]          
In my view, the husband is entitled to an award
of occupation rent from and after April 1. 2016, to the last day of the month
in which the transfer of his interest in the matrimonial home to the wife was
completed, for these reasons:
[80]          
While the husband could have taken meaningful
steps before he amended his pleadings to seek the sale of the matrimonial home,
there was insufficient evidence that he did.
[81]          
Complicating the determination of the amount of
the occupation rent is the fact that the anticipated closing of the sale of the
home and its purchase by Hamed did not happen on June 15, 2023, and has still not
closed as of the date of this Decision. During this time the wife has remained
in sole occupation of the property but had to (likely) pay for interest on the joint
line of credit and the property’s realty taxes and home insurance. In my view,
the wife should pay occupation rent from and after April 1, 2016, to December
31, 2024 (using Mr. Rahman’s 2023 occupation rent value for 2023). The total
occupation rent amounts to $456,400. The wife shall be entitled to a credit of
one-half of all line of credit payments, realty tax and home insurance expenses
paid by her from and after May 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024.
[82]          
The parties had engaged two realtors to
represent their interests in the sale of the matrimonial home. They agreed that
offers were to be submitted to them by 6:30 pm on April 18, 2023. Nine offers
were made. At 6:43 pm the qualifying offers were emailed to the parties and
their lawyers. Seven were in one format (pdf) and two were in different
formats (zip and rar). The highest and best offer (“Zeng”) was
for $2,380,000, without conditions, having a July 14, 2023, completion date. It
was irrevocable until 11:59 pm that night after which it expired. One of the
other offers was from Hamed Sahebolamri, one of the parties’ sons who lived
with his mother in the home; he offered $2,232,000.
[83]          
The husband accepted the Zeng offer shortly
after 10:30 pm. The wife did not accept the offer. Her evidence was that she
couldn’t open the Zeng offer as it wasn’t in pdf format and that she
thought that she had twenty-four hours to consider all the offers because she
had been told this by her realtor. She didn’t contact her realtor for help in
opening the two non-pdf offers. When pressed in cross-examination, the
wife said that “perhaps” she did not open the email at that time, “…perhaps I
was not feeling well...” It was also late. Her agent had sent her an email later
in the evening confirming that her husband had signed the Zeng offer but by
then she had gone to bed because she had health issues and had taken sleeping
medication.
[84]          
It is difficult to accept the wife’s evidence how
the prospective Zeng deal fell through, particularly given her repeated efforts
to oppose or delay the sale. It is not an unreasonable inference that she knew
that Hamed was making or had made a qualifying offer (after all he lived with
her) and that she knew what price he was proposing. The real estate agent was
not called as a witness, nor were Hamed or Maryam who the wife said helped her open
the non-pdf offer. There was no evidence that, in fact, the Zeng offer
was one of the two non-pdf offers.
[85]          
Hamed’s offer was accepted. It proposed a June
15, 2023, completion date but the transaction did not close (and still has not
closed as of the date of the release of these Reasons for Decision) because the
solicitor acting for the parties discovered an undischarged mortgage on title. That
issue was not remedied until July 2024.
[86]          
The Trial Scheduling Order is dated less than a
week after the aborted Zeng/successful Hamid Sahebolamri purchase. The Order
did not address equalization as a trial issue for the wife, but it had always
been a trial issue and was raised as a trial issue by the husband. As for the
husband, he did not raise the recently aborted Zeng sale and presumptive
$148,000 loss as a trial issue in the Order, but it was clearly an issue that
each party addressed in their opening trial statements, which formed part of their
respective trial affidavits (including exhibits) and about which each testified
without objection by the other party.
[87]          
Given what was discovered about the cloud on
title and the time that passed before it was removed, I cannot conclude that
the Zeng deal would have resulted in a completed transaction and that it was
more probable than not it would have closed. In these circumstances, I cannot
conclude that the wife should be held responsible for the presumptive loss of
$148,000.
[88]          
The equalization payment owed is $19,028 payable
by the husband.
[89]          
Excepting occupation rent, the husband owes the
wife for post-valuation date adjustments the sum of $283,783 (rounded) comprising
the following:
[90]          
The total owed then by the husband to the wife
is $302,281.
[91]          
The total occupation rent from and after April
1, 2016, to December 31, 2024, totals $456,400 of which the wife shall be
charged with one-half of that amount or $228,200. In addition, the husband is
entitled to a credit for the unpaid cost awards made by MacPherson J. in 2017 ($9,000),
the Divisional Court in 2018 ($5,000) and, if unpaid, the 2019 order for $2,496.72
made by MacPherson J. These total $16,496.72.
[92]          
The set-off is $57,584.28, say $57,584 (i.e.,
$302,281 less $228,200 less $16,496,72). The husband owes this amount to the
wife plus one-half of all line of credit payments, realty taxes and home
insurance paid by her from and after May 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024. If the
parties cannot agree on the amount of these further adjustments, they can
arrange a conference with me through the judicial assistant for directions.
[93]          
The following is ordered:
[94]          
The amounts ordered to be paid shall be
reflected in, and adjusted when calculating, each party’s respective share of
the net proceeds of sale of the Boyle Drive property.
[95]          
If Hamed’s purchase of the property does not
close on or before December 31, 2024, the property shall be sold under
supervision of the court. Too much time has passed and too little done to bring
the issues in these proceedings to a conclusion.
[96]          
The court encourages the parties to settle costs
by December 31, 2024, failing which the following is ordered:
