This motion is brought by the creditor, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”), for an order against the garnishee, 1530958
Ontario Inc. (“153”), pursuant to Rule 60.08(17) of the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
[2]         
On June 13, 2022, CIBC obtained Judgment against
the defendant, Samuel J. Berkovits (“Mr. Berkovits”), in the sum of $308,560.23
plus costs of $23,475.06 and bearing interest at an annual rate of 19.99%. No
amount has been paid by Mr. Berkovits on account of the Judgment. The Judgment
remains unpaid in its entirety.
[3]         
A Notice of Garnishment to 153, as garnishee,
was issued on August 9, 2022 for the Judgment debt balance of $342,092.14.
[4]         
153 operates Omni Jewel Crafters (“Omni”) which
is a jewelry business and restaurant located at 2793 Bathurst Street, Toronto. Mr.
Berkovits is a director of 153, but he denies being a shareholder or officer.
[5]         
On or about August 25, 2022, 153 was served with
the Notice of Garnishment by mail to 153’s registered head office at 2793 Bathurst
Street, Toronto. Mr. Berkovits was served by mail on or about the same time at
his personal residence located at 136 Dalemount Avenue, North York (the
“Dalemount Property”).
[6]         
On March 28, 2022, CIBC’s lawyer sent a letter to
153 following up on Notice of Garnishment and advising that if no completed
garnishee statement was received within 10 days, CIBC would bring a motion
seeking to enforce the Judgment against 153. 153 did not respond.
[7]         
When no response was received from 153, CIBC
served this motion on 153 and Mr. Berkovits on July 21, 2023.
[8]         
On October 4, 2023, some 13 months following the
date of the Notice of Garnishment, 153 delivered to CIBC a garnishee’s statement,
signed by Mr. Berkovits on behalf of 153 (the “Garnishee’s Statement”), which
states in paragraph 2 the following: “Debtor is Director of Company, not
shareholder or officer. Debtor not entitled to salary.” No other paragraph in
the Garnishee’s Statement was filled out.
[9]         
CIBC conducted an examination in aid of
execution of Mr. Berkovits on June 28, 2023 (the “Examination”). During the
Examination, Mr. Berkovits gave the following testimony:
[10]       In terms of salary, Mr. Berkovits states in his affidavit, sworn
June 10, 2024, at paragraphs 4-6 that:
[11]       It is the position of CIBC that Mr. Berkovits, as director of 153,
uses 153 for cash flow to live on. He admitted during his Examination that he
expends money on behalf of 153 and gets reimbursed. Consequently, CIBC submits
that every time Mr. Berkovits expends money to be reimbursed by 153, there is a
debt owed to him.
[12]       CIBC submits that the Garnishee’s Statement delivered by 153, as
signed by Mr. Berkovits, is materially false and misleading because:
[13]       Based on the foregoing, CIBC submits that 153’s Garnishee’s Statement
is the equivalent of no statement at all.
[14]       As Rule 60.08(17) provides that, where a garnishee does not serve
and file a garnishee’s statement, a creditor is entitled to an order against
the garnishee for payment of the amount that the court finds is payable to the
debtor by the garnishee, or the amount set out in the notice, whichever is
less, CIBC argues that it is entitled to such an order against 153.
[15]       With respect to quantum, CIBC submits that the burden is on 153, as
garnishee, to disclose what reimbursements were paid to Mr. Berkovits since the
date of service of the Notice of Garnishment. As Mr. Berkovits and 153 have not
filed any such evidence, CIBC argues that 153 should be ordered to pay the full
amount of the Judgment. Alternatively, CIBC argues that the court should order
an amount that is just.
[16]       153 submits that it did not serve the Garnishee’s Statement within
the time stipulated by the Rules because its operations manager, Robert Raphael,
received the Notice of Garnishment and did not forward it to Mr.
Berkovits because he either did not understand its importance or did not
believe that 153 was properly named as a garnishee.
[17]       When the Notice of Garnishment did eventually come to the attention
of Mr. Berkovits in or around October 4, 2023, the Garnishee’s Statement was completed, indicating that 153 did not owe any money to Mr. Berkovits.
[18]       153 submits that Mr. Berkovits is
the sole director of 153 but is not an officer, shareholder or employee of same and has not received any compensation from
153 since in or around August of 2022. His last payment predated the service of
the Notice of Garnishment. Consequently, 153 is not a “garnishee” contemplated
by Rule 60.08(2) in that 153 does not have any debts payable to Mr. Berkovits
nor will there be any in the future.
[19]       153 contends that Mr. Berkovits volunteers his time as a director
now out of love and affection for his wife and receives no compensation for his
services.
[20]       In terms of the reimbursements that Mr. Berkovits receives from 153
as compensation for expenses he incurs, 153 argues that these reimbursements
are not “debts payable” and therefore ought not to be included in the
Garnishee’s Statement. In support of this argument, 153 submits that the
Supreme Court of Canada has defined a debt as “sum payable in respect of a
liquidated money demand, recoverable by action” (see Diewold v. Diewold,
[1941] S.C.R. 25 at page 39), which has been adopted by the courts in the
context of garnishments (see Alharayeri v. Wilson, 2018 ONSC 6309).
[21]       In terms of payments received from the Omni business, 153 submits
that Mr. Berkovits and Mrs. Berkovits hold a joint bank account (the “Joint
Account”) and, from time to time, Mrs. Berkovits receives monies from 153 which
she deposits into the Joint Account. According to 153, the monies Mrs.
Berkovits receives from 153 are loan repayments (the “Loan Repayments”) as Mrs.
Berkovits loans significant sums of money to 153 on a revolving basis. For the five-month
time period from October 26, 2023 to March 14, 2024, Mrs. Berkovits received
Loan Repayments from 153 of approximately $105,821 that were deposited into the
Joint Account.
[22]       In support of the Loan Repayments, 153 has produced a summary from
its QuickBooks account software of all the Loan Repayments and expense
reimbursements paid to Mrs. Berkovits for the period of November 6, 2018, to
March 14, 2024. It is the position of 153 that, as of 2022, Mrs. Berkovits had
outstanding shareholder loans owing to her in the sum of $741,544. Further, the
source of these shareholder loans paid to 153 have come from several
individuals, including some family members, but none from Mr. Berkovits.
[23]       Lastly, 153 argues that it would be inequitable and highly
prejudicial for the court to grant an order that 153 pay to CIBC any amounts on
the Judgment for the sole reason that 153 did not provide its Garnishee’s
Statement within the time stipulated by the Rules.
[24]       The relevant provisions pertaining to garnishment are set out in
Rule 60.08 as follows:
[25]       In Benzcar v. Terk, 2023 ONCA 773 (“Benzcar”), the
Ontario Court of Appeal summarized the law pertaining to garnishee statements.
In that decision, the Court highlights the following principles at paragraphs 4,
8, 41, 42 and 46:
[26]       In Benzcar, the Court of Appeal commented on subrule
60.08(17) at paragraph 37 as follows:
[27]       At paragraphs 38 and 39 of Benzcar, the Court of Appeal goes
on to state:
[28]       In Waxman v. Waxman, 2006 CanLII 35815 (ON CA), at paragraphs
37 and 38, the Ontario Court of Appeal cited with approval the following
principles:
[29]      
In 20 Toronto Street
Holdings Ltd. v. Coffee,
Tea or Me Bakeries Inc., 2001 CanLII
28048 (ON SC), at paragraph 5, Nordheimer J. cited Halsbury’s Laws of England,
4th ed., vol. 17 for the proposition that:
[30]       CIBC obtained the Judgment against Mr. Berkovits in June 2022, and
the Notice of Garnishment was served on Mr. Berkovits and on 153 in August 2022.
[31]       The required form for a garnishee’s statement requires disclosure of
not only of what is owed but of what the garnishee will owe because of
arrangements existing when the garnishment notice is served. Conveniently, Mr.
Berkovits ceased taking a salary or receiving any compensation from 153 just
prior to August 2022 when the Notice of Garnishment was served on him and 153.
[32]       It appears that Mr. Berkovits is essentially judgment proof. The
Dalemount Property for which he has lived in for over 30 years is owned by Mrs.
Berkovits and its expenses are paid from 153. His Lexus Lease is paid for by
153. He incurs expenses and receives reimbursement from 153. He has several
credit cards in his name and the payments for those cards come from 153. He has
a non-exigible RRSP.
[33]       Mr. Berkovits and 153 now seek to defeat the Notice of Garnishment
that has been served upon them.
[34]       Taking into consideration the totality of facts, including the
evidence proffered and the lack of evidence proffered, I find that Mr.
Berkovits has arranged his finances in concert with 153 to avoid having any
amount garnished from 153 to pay CIBC’s Judgment. The basis for this finding is
set out in the below paragraphs.
[35]       Firstly, I do not accept the evidence of Mr. Berkovits and Mrs.
Berkovits that the Notice of Garnishment was not brought to 153’s attention
until October of 2023. Mr. Berkovits was served with the Notice of Garnishment
at the Dalemount Property in August of 2022 and therefore would have known
about its existence and the requirement to respond at that time. He is a
director of 153 and has a duty not only to manage and supervise the activities
and affairs of 153, but to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the
best interests of the corporation.  Upon receiving the Notice of Garnishment in
his personal capacity, Mr. Berkovits knew or ought to have known that CIBC was
attempting to garnish 153 for his debt and that 153 was obliged to respond as
early as August 2022.
[36]       Secondly, there is no supporting evidence filed in response to this
motion from Robert Raphael, the office manager of 153, regarding the position
of Mr. and Mrs. Berkovits that Mr. Raphael received the Notice of Garnishment
but failed to act on it. I note that Mr. Raphael did swear an affidavit, sworn
June 10, 2024, but that it fails to address his alleged receipt of the Notice
of Garnishment. I draw a negative inference from the fact that Mr. Raphael did
not provide any evidence in his affidavit regarding the Notice of Garnishment.
[37]       Third, CIBC’s lawyers sent a follow up letter to 153 on or about
March 28, 2023, requiring a response to the Notice of Garnishment. There is no
evidence from 153 as to why this letter did not prompt a response. Further,
CIBC served its Motion Record on both Mr. Berkovits and 153 on or about July
21, 2023. Again, there is no explanation as to why it took until October of
2023 for 153 to deliver the Garnishee Statement having received this motion in
July of 2023.
[38]       Given the foregoing, I find that 153 opted not to deliver any
response to the Notice of Garnishment until it felt obliged to do so following
the delivery of this motion. In the meantime, 153 took steps to avoid
compliance with the Notice of Garnishment.
[39]       In his Examination, Mr. Berkovits testified as follows:
[40]       No evidence was proffered by 153
regarding what salary Mr. Berkovits was paid by 153, if any, predating 2021.
Similarly, no supporting documentation was proffered by 153 in respect of the
advice it purportedly received from its accountant regarding the salary paid to
Mr. Berkovits during 2021 and 2022 that suddenly ceased in or just prior to
August 2022. On its face, it seems very convenient and favourable to Mr.
Berkovits and 153 that the salary was paid to him during Covid-19 to qualify
for relief programs and then ceased just prior to the date of the Notice of
Garnishment.
[41]       Additionally, no particulars have been provided by 153 regarding the
last salary payment (or in fact any payments) received by Mr. Berkovits.
[42]       I draw negative inferences from these omissions.
[43]       I also find that Mr. Berkovits has a degree of control over 153.
This control includes signing the Garnishee’s Statement on 153’s behalf and
determining when and how much of a salary he should receive.
[44]       In his affidavit, sworn June 10, 2024, Mr. Berkovits states the
following at paragraphs 6 and 7 regarding the salary he received from 153 for
the years 2021 and 2022:
[45]       I disagree with Mr. Berkovits statement in paragraph 7 of his
affidavit that there was “no longer any point for [him] to draw a salary from
153”. There was indeed a point for him continuing to draw a salary from 153,
and that point was that he was significantly indebted to CIBC and required to
pay the Judgment. Despite this, 153 and Mr. Berkovits opted not to pay him a
salary although he continued to provide services “24 hours a day, 7 days a week”.
It seems that when it is beneficial for 153 and Mr. Berkovits to pay him a
salary, he is to receive one, yet if it is not beneficial to either, then he is
not to be paid one.
[46]       I also do not find it credible that Mr.
Berkovits would be working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at Omni solely out of
love and affection for his wife, particularly when he has been paid a salary in
the past.
[47]       In my opinion, to say that Mr. Berkovits is not entitled to a salary
is really to say that Mr. Berkovits and 153 have determined that he shall not
be paid a salary.
[48]       Mr. Berkovits admitted (through his counsel) that money goes in and
out from 153 to him for reimbursement of expenses. Mr. Berkovits also admitted
that he receives reimbursements from 153 for expenses such as “gas, dining and
interest” and that 153 pays for his Lexus Lease. He also has his household
expenses and property maintenance expenses paid, at least in part, by the
cashflow from 153.
[49]       When asked on Examination if 153 pays for all his expenses, he
stated: “Many of my expenses. Most of my expenses are related to the company.”
[50]       No particulars or supporting documentation has been provided by 153
regarding the nature of these expenses, the amounts paid or the frequency of
the payments. There is no evidence before me, apart from the affidavits filed
by Mr. and Mrs. Berkovits, that these expenses are proper business expenses.
[51]       I note that 153 has produced the Vendor Quickbook Reports showing
payments from 153 to Mrs. Berkovits but has not produced similar reports that
would show the historical payments to Mr. Berkovits.
[52]       I also draw negative inferences from this lack of disclosure.
[53]       I also agree with plaintiff’s submissions that as soon as an expense
was incurred by Mr. Berkovits for 153 that required reimbursement, a debt and
payment obligation was created. The expenses and Mr. Berkovits’ claim for
reimbursement are sums payable in respect of a liquidated amount. Had 153 not
reimbursed Mr. Berkovits for proper and approved expenses he incurred on behalf
of 153, he most certainly would have a liquidated claim for which he could have
demanded and recovered by way of action against 153.
[54]       Given the foregoing, I find the statement (or the lack of any
statement) in the Garnishee’s Statement that no amounts are payable or have
been paid to Mr. Berkovits by 153 to be false, and certainly misleading. At
minimum, payment was being made to reimburse him for expenses and 153 was
paying personal expenses for him on an ongoing basis. As stated above, no
particulars have been provided regarding these “expenses” or “reimbursements”
and no mention of these expenses or reimbursements was divulged in the
Garnishee’s Statement.
[55]       As is the case with payment of Mr. Berkovits’ salary, to say that
153 does not owe any monies to Mr. Berkovits is really to say that Mr.
Berkovits and 153 have determined that he is not owed any monies by 153.
[56]       I also find the supporting documentation provided by Mr. Berkovits
and Mrs. Berkovits regarding the alleged loans Mrs. Berkovits has provided to
153 and the Loan Payments she has received to be unpersuasive. I am of this
opinion for the following reasons:
[57]       Although two affidavits have been proffered by 153 in support of the
third-party loans: 1) an affidavit of Mr. Raphael attesting to the fact that he
has been employed by 153 since 2022 and, in August 2017, he loaned $300,000 to
Mrs. Berkovits; and 2) an affidavit of Moses Bergman, sworn October 4, 2023,
which sets out how Mr. Bergman has lent Mrs. Berkovits over a million dollars
over the years; no supporting documentation or particulars have been provided in
either affidavit regarding the terms of the loan and terms of repayment. There
is also a blank in paragraph 4 of Mr. Bergman’s affidavit pertaining to the
balance of the loan.
[58]       Overall, I do not find that 153 has produced cogent and convincing
evidence to establish that the payments flowing from 153 to the Joint Account
and to Mrs. Berkovits are solely on account of Loan Repayments or that the
source of those payments came from third parties, which require repayment.
[59]       153 argues that it is not a “garnishee”
contemplated by Rule 60.08(2) because it does not have any debts payable to Mr.
Berkovits nor will there be any in the future. If in fact there are no debts
payable to Mr. Berkovits now or in the future as 153 alleges, I find it only to
be the case because Mr. Berkovits and 153 have determined it to be so. I find
that 153 is a garnishee as contemplated by Rule 60.08(2). To find otherwise
would be to reward 153 for its conduct in organizing its affairs in concert
with Mr. Berkovits to avoid compliance with the Notice of Garnishment.
[60]       As noted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Benzcar, the
purpose of the garnishee statement is to accurately delineate the issue between
the creditor and the garnishee. I find that the Garnishee Statement delivered
by 153 defeated the very purpose of what was required.
[61]       In taking into account the circumstances as a whole, I find that the
Garnishee Statement was materially false and contained material omissions
without reasonable justification. At the very least, the Garnishee’s Statement
ought to have detailed the last payment made to Mr. Berkovits, set out the
reimbursements that had been paid to him, as well as any personal benefits
being paid on his behalf by 153 for the relevant time period, and set out its
justification as to why no amount was now payable. The Garnishee’s Statement
also ought to have set out the salary that Mr. Berkovits had been receiving,
the date it ceased, and its justification as to why he was not receiving a
salary from 153. Instead, 153 gave a self-serving statement with no supporting
documentation, which I find was akin to a “catch me if you can.” I therefore
find that the Garnishee’s Statement amounted to no statement at all.
[62]       I also find the Garnishee’s Statement to be materially deficient
because it does not contain any detail or information pertaining to the 13
months that had transpired since the service of the Notice of Garnishment. Just
because the Garnishee’s Statement was delivered 13 months’ late, does not mean
that 153 does not have to account for the 13-month time period that predated
its delivery.
[63]       Given this finding, CIBC is entitled an Order for payment by the
garnishee in an amount equal to the amount payable or that has been paid to Mr.
Berkovits since service of the Notice of Garnishment, or the amount of the
Judgment, whichever is less in accordance with Rule 60.08(17).
[64]       As set out in Benzcar, if no statement has been served and
filed, the court’s second task is to determine the amount payable by the
garnishee to the debtor. Once an amount is determined, the third task is to
give effect to the creditor’s entitlement to an order in the lesser amount or
the amount in the notice.
[65]       The difficulty in this case lies in the lack of evidence filed by
the parties in respect of the amounts payable to Mr. Berkovits by 153.
[66]       In Benzcar, there was sufficient evidence before the Motions
Judge to determine that the amounts payable to the debtor from the garnishee exceeded
the amount in the notice of garnishment. As such, the court ordered that the
garnishee pay the creditor the amount in the notice, as it was the lesser
amount. Here, I lack the requisite information to make such a determination.
[67]       Further, as a garnishee order is an equitable remedy, I am cautious
not to order the attachment of debt inequitably or unfairly such that it may
cause undue prejudice or injustice to 153.
[68]       Given the foregoing, I find that my determination of the amount to
be paid by 153 to CIBC pursuant to Rule 60.08(17) is adjourned to permit 153
the opportunity to provide further documentation regarding compensation paid to
Mr. Berkovits. In that regard, in exercising my discretion to make an order as
I determine to be just and appropriate in the circumstances, I order that
within sixty (60) days from the date of this Endorsement, 153 shall serve on
CIBC the following documentation:
[69]       The motion shall be adjourned to a TBST date before me, to be
scheduled through the Trial Office to discuss next steps following the delivery
of the above documentation and/or if there has been no compliance with the
order.
