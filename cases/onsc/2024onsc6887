Henok Banjaw and Telique Ricketts are jointly charged on an indictment
with crimes arising from the death of Adrian Richardson on May 2, 2022. Telique
Ricketts is charged with second degree murder and Henok Banjaw is charged with
manslaughter.
[2]               
Their jury trial is set to commence on the April 2025 running list with
jury selection on April 7 and the trial commencing on April 21.
[3]               
Mr. Banjaw brings this application to sever his charges from those of
Mr. Ricketts in order to have his own trial.
[4]               
For the reasons that follow, the application for severance is dismissed.
[5]               
Mr. Banjaw alleges that his role in the incident
leading to Mr. Richardson’s death is limited to driving Ricketts and two others
– Mr. Collander and Mr. Green – to Mr. Richardson’s residence. He alleges that
he remained in the car while the others entered Mr. Richardson’s residence.
[6]               
Both Green and Collander have given statements
to the police, and it is anticipated that they will be entering guilty pleas
soon. The issue is whether Mr. Banjaw knew that the others planned to rob Mr.
Richardson, and whether he knew that Ricketts had a handgun. Apparently, Mr. Collander
will testify that Mr. Banjaw had no notion that a robbery was about to take
place or that a firearm would be used. On the other hand, Mr. Green will
testify that everyone, including Mr. Banjaw, was aware as they drove to Mr.
Richardson’s residence, that Mr. Richardson was to be robbed with a gun and further,
that Ricketts showed everyone the handgun.
[7]               
Mr. Banjaw seeks to have his charges severed “as
a matter of judicial efficiency” and states that, if severed, he would elect
trial by judge alone and that the trial would last three to four days rather
than three weeks with a jury as currently scheduled.
[8]               
Although a Charter 11(b) application has
not been formally made, Mr. Banjaw notes that the net delay to the anticipated
end of trial is approximately 32.5 months, which is above the 30-month
presumptive Jordan ceiling.  Mr. Banjaw argues that, if severed, the
judge alone trial could be completed within 30 months.
[9]               
Mr. Ricketts takes no position on this
application.
[10]           
The Crown opposes severance, as the co-accused
are alleged to have participated in a joint enterprise resulting in Mr.
Richardson’s death. The Crown further notes that two trials will require the
duplication of testimony and take unnecessary, additional judicial resources,
which are scant at best. As to 11(b), the Crown notes that no application has
been brought, no precise calculation of the net delay has been made, and that
complexity may extend the presumptive ceiling in cases involving co-accused.
[11]           
The Court may, where it is satisfied that
interests of justice so require, order that an accused be tried separately from
another pursuant to s. 591(3)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46.
[12]           
The interests of justice “encompass those of the
accused, the co-accused, and the community as represented by the prosecution”[1]
[13]           
Persons accused of joint commission of a crime
should be tried together.[2]
An accused seeking severance must overcome the presumption that co-accused who
are jointly charged, and who are said to have acted in concert, should be tried
together.[3]
[14]           
Severance is not to be ordered “unless it is
established that a joint trial will work an injustice to the accused”[4]
[15]           
Factors that courts have considered in severance
applications include the following: [5]
[16]           
Severance can also be granted when an accused
contends that his right to make full answer and defence will be prejudiced
unless the co-accused can be compelled to testify.[6]
[17]           
The charges against the two accused are both
factually and legally connected and, presumptively, should be tried together.
[18]           
The 11(b) issue is yet to be determined and no
formal application has been brought. It is not clear that an 11(b) application
would succeed.
[19]           
Multiple proceedings will require duplication of
testimony and will challenge judicial resources.
[20]           
Mr. Banjaw has not established that a joint
trial will work an injustice to him.
[21]           
The application is dismissed.
[22]           
Counsel for Mr. Banjaw has indicated that one day is
required for cross-examination of the deponent of the ITO for the wiretap
authorization and argument on whether the authorization should have issued.
Counsel are to arrange a date for this argument with the trial co-ordinator.
That date is to be confirmed at assignment court on January 27, 2025. If that
application cannot be set before the trial judge, I will appoint a case
management judge to hear the application.
