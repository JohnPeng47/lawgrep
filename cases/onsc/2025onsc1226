[1]             
This was an action for a liquidated claim:
payment of four invoices. The amount claimed to be owing as of the date of
trial was $155,649.21, comprised of the invoiced amount of $57,620.96 plus
interest of $98,028.25.
[2]              
The invoices were rendered for accounting
services provided to the corporate defendant, 1583057 Ontario Inc. (the “Pop
Shoppe”). The individual defendant, Brian Alger, is the principal of the Pop
Shoppe. The plaintiff alleged that Mr. Alger was jointly liable for payment of
the invoices.
[3]              
The trial took less than two days to be heard[1] and was conducted in an efficient manner. It was heard partly by way
of affidavit and partly through oral evidence. The documents, including key excerpts
from examinations, were collated into a well-organized brief and only two
witnesses were called at trial.
[4]              
The defendants raised four main defences. The
two main defences were: 1) the plaintiff’s claim was barred by the Limitations
Act, 2002; and 2) the plaintiff was entitled to interest at the rate set
out in the invoices. The other two defences were easily overcome: Mr. Alger had
signed documents confirming he was personally liable and accepting the invoiced
amounts.
[5]              
In Reasons for Judgment released January 20,
2025 (the “Reasons”), I found that the plaintiff had established entitlement to
payment on three of the four invoices. The plaintiff failed to establish
delivery of a fourth invoice, which was held to be statute-barred.
[6]              
Following trial, the parties agreed that the principal
owing on the invoices was $56,500.17.
[7]              
As explained in the Reasons, I concluded that
limitation periods were reset from time to time, which entitled the plaintiff
to judgment on three of the four invoices.
[8]              
The second significant issue was whether the
plaintiff was entitled to charge and collect interest at the rate of 16.1% per
annum, as set out in the invoices. The plaintiff’s interest claim of $98,028.25
comprised close to 63% of the total amount claimed.
[9]              
The plaintiff was unsuccessful in establishing
entitlement to prejudgment interest as claimed. As explained in the Reasons,
the plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest at the Courts of Justice
Act[2] (“CJA”) rate.
[10]          
In its costs submissions, the plaintiff advises
that the parties agreed that, by applying the CJA interest rate, the
total interest owing to the date of the Reasons totals $2,861.76. They also
agreed that the total judgment amount, before costs, and after giving the
defendants credit for payments made toward the invoices, is $56,738.39. That
figure is arrived at as follows:
[11]          
As per the Reasons, Mr. Alger was unsuccessful
in his defence that he was not personally liable on the invoices.
[12]          
While the plaintiff asserts that it was
successful on its claim, it also acknowledges that the judgment amount of
$57,738.39 is significantly less than the $155,649.21 claimed, attributable
primarily to the reduction in the interest claimed from $98,028.25 to $2,861.76.
[13]          
In determining costs, the plaintiff asks that the
court find that the plaintiff achieved a better outcome at trial than it would
have achieved, had it accepted the defendants’ settlement offer.
[14]          
The plaintiff seeks partial indemnity costs of $46,698.61.
The defendant asks that no costs be awarded or, at the least, that costs be
“greatly reduced” from the amount sought.
[15]          
In its cost submissions, the plaintiff
acknowledges that its offer to settle, dated July 30, 2024, ought not to have
an impact upon the scale of costs to which the plaintiff is entitled. In that
offer, the plaintiff agreed to accept payment of $150,000 in full and final
settlement of all claims, in return for which the action would be discontinued
without costs.
[16]          
For his part, Mr. Alger referenced the
defendants’ offer to settle dated August 30, 2024, in which they offered to pay
a total of $57,620.96 by way of four quarterly instalments: on January 1, 2025,
April 1, 2025, July 1, 2025 and October 1, 2025.
[17]          
Mr. Alger also referenced his settlement
negotiations with counsel for the plaintiff, in which he explained that he did
not have funds to make payment in full, which is why his offer contemplated
payment in four instalments.
[18]          
Section 131(1) of the CJA gives the court
discretion to determine by whom and to what extent costs are to be paid.
[19]          
In civil litigation, costs usually follow the
event. That rule should not be departed from except for very good reasons: see Gonawati
v. Teitsson 2002 CanLII 41469 (ONCA), [2002] CarswellOnt 1007 (Ont. C.A.)],
2002 CanLII 41469 and Macfie v. Cater, 1920 CanLII 401 (ON SC), [1920] O.J. No. 71 (H.C.J.) at
para 28): Usanovic v. La Capital Life Ins., 2016 ONSC 5795 CanLII, at
para. 7.
[20]          
Costs are discretionary and, in the exercise of
that discretion, the court is to consider the factors set out in Rule 57.01
of the Rules of Civil Procedure[3]:
[21]          
In 394 Lakeshore Oakville Holdings Inc. v.
Misek, 2010 ONSC 7238
(CanLII), [2010] O.J. No.
5692 (Ont. S.C.J.), Perell J. reformulated the purposes of the
modern costs rules, at para. 10, as follows:
[22]          
Overall, the objective is to fix an amount that
is fair and reasonable, having regard for, among other things, the expectations
of the parties concerning the quantum of costs:  Boucher v. Public
Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d)
291 (C.A.) at paras. 26 and 38.
[23]          
A costs award should reflect what the court
views as a fair and reasonable contribution by the unsuccessful party to the
successful party rather than any exact measure of the actual costs to the
successful litigant: Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier, 2002 CanLII 25577 (ON
CA), 2002 CarswellOnt 4020, 118 A.C.W.S. (3d) 341
(C.A.), at para. 4: Fehr et al. v. Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, 2021
ONSC 8368 (CanLII), at para 83).
[24]          
I first consider the relative success of the
parties. While the plaintiff was successful in obtaining a judgment against the
defendants, the total judgment amount is approximately one-third of the amount
claimed.
[25]          
With respect to the amount claimed in
pre-judgment interest, I find the defendants were successful, as the amount claimed
was reduced from $98,028.25 to $2,861.76.
[26]          
As noted above, the limitation period and the
interest claimed were the central issues for trial.  The other two defences – Mr.
Alger’s denial of personal liability and the defendants’ assertion that the
invoices were excessive and/or for work not performed – were all but extinguished
by Mr. Alger’s admissions on his examination for discovery.
[27]          
The plaintiff acknowledges that its settlement
offer does not entitle it to an elevated costs award. While the defendants
offer to settle exceeded the principal amount awarded, it did not include any
amount for costs and, also, contemplated payment over time. Notwithstanding
those deficiencies, in my view, the defendants offer is one that ought to be
taken into account pursuant to Rule 49.13.
[28]          
In his cost submissions, Mr. Alger asserts that,
instead of initiating litigation, the plaintiff ought to have engaged in
settlement discussions, in recognition of the ongoing professional relationship
between the parties extending nearly 23 years. While that submission would
carry greater weight had the defendants paid the invoiced amounts (without
interest), I understand the defendants to say that the plaintiff has always
understood and accepted that the defendants were limited in their ability to
pay the invoices.
[29]          
In my view, the defendants’ offer to settle must
be viewed in the context of the parties’ long-standing business relationship
and the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendants’ limited financial wherewithal
– as the plaintiff prepared Pop Shoppe’s financial statements and Mr. Alger’s
personal income tax returns for many years.
[30]          
Specifically, in his email to counsel for the
plaintiff proposing a payment plan, Mr. Alger specifically disclosed that he
would not be able to satisfy the terms of any agreement that required a payment
in full, which is why he proposed a payment plan.
[31]          
The plaintiff submits that had it accepted the
defendants’ offer, which did not contemplate payments beginning until January
1, 2025, it would have lost interest, to that date alone, of $1,045.86.
[32]          
As to the r. 57 factors, the plaintiff submits
that the factors at r. 57.01(1)(0.a) and 57.01 (1)(a) are the most relevant.
[33]          
The plaintiff’s costs outline sets out the names
and years of call of the lawyers with carriage of the claim, the time spent and
the hourly rates charged. I note that the majority of the work was performed by
Daniel Lilko, who is described as having 7 years’ experience. I find that it
was appropriate for this matter to be handled by Mr. Lilko, who would have been
a relatively junior lawyer when the claim was issued.
[34]          
The hours spent were significant: Mr. Lilko
reports over 160 hours spent on the claim, including trial, which was
approximately one and ½ days. However, the hours spent must also be viewed in
the context of the relatively low hourly rate charged. Overall, I do not find
the time spent to be overly excessive.
[35]          
On this factor, the plaintiff submits that it
succeeded in obtaining a judgment equal to approximately 36.45% of the amount
sought. Conversely, it must be recognized that the defendants succeeded in
reducing the plaintiff’s claim by 63.55%.
[36]          
The plaintiff submits that the outcome achieved should
not be a basis to reduce the costs claimed.
[37]          
I do not agree. To accept the plaintiff’s
submission would render r. 57.01(1)(a) meaningless.
[38]          
In my view, in view the plaintiff’s lack of
success on the interest portion of its claim must be taken into account in
fixing costs.
[39]          
As noted in the Reasons, the plaintiff had never
collected interest on invoices, nor ever sent a statement quantifying the
interest due. Rather, in his long business relationship with the plaintiff, Mr.
Alger had been allowed to pay invoices when he was able to do so and was never
charged interest. The plaintiff’s interest claim of $98,028.25 was an
unsuccessful overreach which must be reflected in the costs awarded.
[40]          
For the reasons set out, in the exercise of my
discretion, I fix the plaintiff’s costs at $18,000, inclusive of
disbursements and taxes.
[41]          
In my view this costs award recognizes the plaintiff’s
success in the action; the defendants’ success on the interest issue; the
defendants’ offer to resolve the dispute without a trial, which was informed by
the defendants’ ability to pay the debt; and is an amount that is fair and
reasonable for the defendants to pay.
[42]          
This costs award is payable by the defendants
to the plaintiff within 30 days.
[43]          
Interest is to accrue in accordance with the CJA.
