[1]         
This application was brought by Deborah Lynn Ferris
(“DLF”), one of two named co-estate trustees of the estate of their late father
(the “Estate”), who died on October 28, 2022 (the “Deceased”). DLF asserted
that her brother, Christopher Ferris (“CF”), refused to cooperate with her in
the administration of the Estate. DLF’s application was for the removal of CF as
an estate trustee, and for an order appointing her as sole estate trustee. The
application was heard, and granted, on October 15, 2024.
[2]         
DLF and CF each receive 47% of the Estate. The
remaining 6% of the Estate is divided as follows: 2% to the Deceased’s third
child, Gregory Merrell Ferris (“GMF”), and 2% to each of GMF’s two children.
[3]         
CF opposed the application. The other respondents attended
at the hearing but did not otherwise participate.
[4]         
As DLF was successful on her application, she is
presumptively entitled to her costs. DLF and CF were invited to make written
costs submissions, and this decision follows the receipt and review of those
submissions.
[5]         
The application first came before me on September 5,
2024. On that date, I granted an interim order, the effect of which was to allow
DLF to take steps to move forward with the administration of the Estate and to
restrain CF from interfering with DLF in that task. The hearing of the application
was then adjourned to October 15, 2024, peremptory upon CF.
[6]         
 On October 10, 2024, CF filed his own motion for an
order transferring this application to Simcoe. DLF delivered a responding
record on October 10, 2024. (The late delivery of CF’s motion record made it impossible
for DLF’s responding record to meet the timelines under the Notice to
Profession, which requires materials to be uploaded 5 days before a hearing.)
[7]         
CF’s motion did not proceed on October 15, 2024. However,
in my oral ruling on the application, I acknowledged that a Certificate of Appointment
of Estate Trustee would need to be issued out of the Simcoe court, and ordered
that to the extent possible, the Simcoe court office give that application
priority.  In my view, my ruling rendered moot CF’s motion to transfer this
application to Simcoe.
[8]         
DLF seeks full indemnity costs of $26,474.82 of which she
asks that CF pay $23,863, on substantial indemnity basis (90%). DLF asks that the
balance of her full indemnity costs be paid from the Estate.
[9]         
In his responding costs submissions, CF submits that the
Estate should pay both parties’ “reasonable costs on a substantial indemnity
basis” which, he submits, would be “equal to 75% of the claimed costs submitted
by the parties”.
[10]      I understand from CF’s submissions that he agrees that 75% of the
costs claimed by DLF would be “reasonable”.
[11]      In her costs submissions, DLF references the costs principles set
out in Dewaele v Roobroeck, 2021 ONSC 1604, a decision of this Court in
an estate matter. Dewaele states as follows:
[12]      In his costs submissions, CF references the more recent decision of McGrath
v. Joy, 2022 ONCA 119 (CanLII). In McGrath, the appellate court overturned
the lower court’s finding that a suicide note was not a codicil. The Court
found that the circumstances surrounding the suicide note led to the litigation
– i.e. it was the deceased’s conduct that caused the litigation. The Court
found that public policy considerations applied such that the application was
necessary to ensure that the deceased’s estate was properly administered, and,
for that reason, all parties were entitled to their costs of the application
from the estate.
[13]     
Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O.
1990, Reg. 194, sets out factors that I may consider in
exercising my discretion. Overall, the objective is to fix an amount that is
fair and reasonable, having regard for, among other things, the expectations of
the parties concerning the quantum of costs: see Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province
of Ontario, 2004
CanLII 14579 (ON CA), at paras. 26 and 38.
[14]      The entitlement of an estate trustee to indemnification for
reasonably incurred costs was confirmed in Sawdon. At para. 82 the Court
stated:
[15]      R. 57.01(4)(c) authorizes an award of costs on a substantial
indemnity basis “where the losing party has engaged in behaviour worthy of
sanction”: see Davies v. Clarington
(Municipality), 2009 ONCA 722,
100 O.R. (3d) 66, at para. 28. Elevated
costs should only be awarded where “there has been reprehensible,
scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of one of the parties”: see
Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 134.
[16]      At para. 10 of his costs submissions, CF states: “It may be that how
each or both of the parties conducted themselves and engaged in the dispute was
unnecessarily provocative or even toxic. However, the uncivil tone of the
dispute does not point to either party taking an unreasonable position”.
[17]      In my view, the behaviour described above does apply to CF, but not
to DLF. And, while I agree that an “uncivil tone” does not equate to taking an
“unreasonable position”, in this case CF both took an uncivil tone and an
unreasonable position. Both can be seen in CF’s letter of February 3, 2023 to DLF’s
estate lawyer, Walter Jazvac. The letter begins:
[18]      Another example, may be found in CF’s transfer motion filed on
October 10, 2024, in the face of an existing court order directing that the
application proceed on October 15, 2024, peremptory upon CF.
[19]      DLF seeks her costs of responding to CF’s motion which, she states,
CF refused to abandon even after the ruling of October 15, 2024.
[20]     
In oral reasons, I found that CF ought to be
removed as an estate trustee of the Estate, and that DLF be permitted to apply
to act as sole estate trustee. The oral reasons state, in part:
[21]      In my view, DLF is entitled to full indemnity of her reasonable
costs. I also find that CF’s conduct is worthy of sanction and can be
characterized as reprehensible and outrageous. For that reason, I conclude that
it is proper for me to exercise my discretion to award costs against him on an
elevated scale.
[22]      In determining what amount is reasonable, I have taken into account CF’s
submission that 75% of the amount claimed by DLF is reasonable. I have also looked
at CF’s full indemnity costs, which total $8,023.00, but which do not appear to
include all time spent. For example, Mr. Bowyer has made no entry for his court
attendance on September 5, 2024, for which Mr. Wiseman recorded 1.4 hours.
[23]      In addition, DLF includes her costs of responding to CF’s transfer
motion, which has been rendered moot by the Order made on October 15, 2024. I
accept that DLF is entitled to her costs of CF’s motion, which are included in
the amount awarded to her here.
[24]      Having considered the parties’ submissions and the applicable legal
principles, I fix DLF’s fair and reasonable costs of this application and CF’s
transfer motion at $26,474.82.
[25]      For the reasons set out, I find that DLF, as an estate trustee, is
entitled to be fully indemnified for her costs.
[26]      I make the following blended costs order, payable forthwith:
[27]      I award no costs to CF for the application or for his transfer
motion.
