    "summary": "The court addressed the issue of the distribution of Legal Expense Insurance funds after Belton's claim was dismissed and costs were awarded against him. MHA obtained the insurance, and a dispute arose concerning the entitlement and distribution of $100,000 policy funds. The ruling clarified the interpretation of the insurance policy, ordering a pro rata sharing of the funds. Belton's new application was dismissed, and the policy funds were allocated to offset the defendant's costs due to MHA's waiver of claims."
