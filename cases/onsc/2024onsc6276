The defendants Raw Design Inc., Pierre-Alexandre Le Lay and Roland Rom Colthoff
(the “defendants”) bring this motion for an order transferring this action from
Milton (Central West Region) to the Toronto Region. This motion is brought
pursuant to Rule 13.1.02 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990,
Reg. 194 (the “Rules”) and the procedures set forth in the Consolidated
Civil Provincial Practice Direction amended February 1, 2024, (the “Practice
Direction”). The plaintiffs Core Birchcliff Limited Partnership, Birchcliff
Core Harbour Inc., Mazenga Building Group Ltd. and Core Development Group Ltd.
(the “plaintiffs”) oppose the motion.
[2]              
In accordance with the Practice Direction, I am to determine this motion
in writing in my capacity as the Regional Senior Judge for the Toronto Region.
[3]              
For the reasons that follow, I order that this action be transferred
from Milton to Toronto.
[4]              
This action is in relation to a multi-unit residential townhome development
project (the “project”) located in the City of Toronto. The plaintiffs issued a
request for proposals for architectural services relating to the project. The
defendant architectural firm was subsequently retained to provide architectural
services regarding the project pursuant to a written contract dated January 12,
2017. The plaintiffs allege that damages were sustained as a result of the defendants’
negligence and breach of contract.
[5]              
Rule 46.01 provides that the trial of an action shall be held in the county
where the proceeding was commenced or to which it has been transferred under
Rule 13.01.02 unless the court orders otherwise. Rule 13.1.02 and the Practice
Directions direct how a change of venue motion should proceed. Subsection (2) of
the Rule provides:
[6]              
Subsection (2)(a) has no application. There is no suggestion that a fair
hearing cannot be held in Milton.
[7]              
The factors set forth in Rule 13.1.02(2)(b) are to be applied holistically.
No one of the enumerated factors is more important than the other. These
factors are to be examined together and balanced in order to determine whether
a requested transfer is desirable in the interests of justice: Darteh v.
Gross, 2017 ONSC 2479, at paras. 8-9; Hilson v. 1336365 Alberta Ltd.,
2017 ONSC 4990, at paras. 12-13; Chatterson et. al. v. M&M
Meat Shops Ltd., 2014 ONSC 1897, 68 C.P.C. (7th)
135 (Div. Ct.), at para. 22; Siemens Canada v. Ottawa (City) (2008), 2008 CanLII 48152 (ON SC), 93
O.R. (3d) 220 (S.C.), at para. 25; and Walcott v. Zheng, 2021
ONSC 4679, at paras. 20, 22-23.
[8]              
In applying the “holistic approach” it is important to recognize that
the balancing of the Rule 13.1.02(2)(b) factors is not a purely numerical or
mathematical counting exercise: Bruce Power L.P. v. BNT Canada, L.P., 2018
ONSC 5968.
[9]              
At first instance a plaintiff(s) is entitled to commence a proceeding at
any court location: Chatterson, at para. 14. If the plaintiff’s
choice of venue is reasonable and the defendant challenges that venue, then a
comparison of the two venues is required. The defendant must establish that its
proposed choice of venue is significantly better than the one chosen by the
plaintiff:  Chatterson, at paras. 28-29; Walcott, at para. 28.
[10]          
The subject matter of this proceeding, namely the project is located in
the City of Toronto. No part of the project is located in the Town of Milton.
Further, the contractual agreement was negotiated in the City of Toronto, and all
events and alleged omissions giving rise to this proceeding occurred in the
City of Toronto. All building permits were issued by the City of Toronto.
[11]          
The registered office address of the four corporate plaintiffs is in the
City of Toronto. The corporate defendant is located in the City of Toronto. The
two individual defendants reside in the City of Toronto. Counsel for all
parties are located in Toronto.
[12]          
The plaintiffs argue that one of its most important witnesses resides in
Mississauga and two of their primary witnesses are located in Markham and Vaughan,
respectively. The defendants submit that their potential third-party witnesses
are located in Toronto or communities directly to the north of Toronto.
[13]          
The plaintiffs argue that a transfer of this action from Milton to
Toronto is not desirable in the interest of justice because doing so will cause
delay in scheduling the trial date, pre-trial date and motion dates. This
submission cannot be considered in isolation.
[14]          
This proceeding was commenced in 2023 and pleadings were closed in March
2024. It appears that no steps have been taken to advance the litigation since
that time.
[15]          
In applying the factors under Rule 13.1.02(2)(b) holistically to the
factual matrix of this proceeding, I am satisfied that there is no rational
connection to Milton and that, on balance, Toronto is a substantially better
venue. Counsel are at liberty to use the procedural tools available to them under
the Rules to ensure the action proceeds in an orderly and timely fashion.
[16]          
In this regard, following the transfer of this action to the Toronto
Region, I direct that a case conference be scheduled before me pursuant to Rule
50.13(1) to establish a timetable for the proceeding.
[17]          
I encourage the parties to agree on the costs of this motion. If they
cannot, the defendants are to deliver their written cost submissions of no more
than two pages by November 20, 2024. The plaintiffs are to deliver their
responding submissions of the same length by November 27, 2024. Any reply is to
be delivered by December 2, 2024.
