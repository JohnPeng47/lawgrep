Mr. Dallner
sues Dr. Gladwell
for medical malpractice. There is no issue that Mr.
Dallner suffered an injury to his brachial plexus during shoulder replacement
surgery performed by Dr. Gladwell on January 4, 2018. The sole issue is whether
the plaintiff has proven surgical negligence on the part of Dr. Gladwell. There are no allegations of
improper pre- or post-operative care. The plaintiff withdrew his allegation of
lack of informed consent.
[2]         
I have concluded that it is more likely
than not that Mr. Dallner’s
injury resulted from surgical
negligence on the part of Dr. Gladwell. I therefore find for the plaintiff.
[3]         
The plaintiff
must prove that the defendant was negligent, and that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s loss. To prove
negligence, the plaintiff must show that:
[4]         
In this case,
there can be no doubt that Dr. Gladwell owed Mr. Dallner a duty of care. There is also no doubt that Mr. Dallner sustained
an injury in the surgery,
and that the injury resulted
in damages. The focus of the dispute is whether Dr. Gladwell breached the
standard of care and whether that breach caused Mr. Dallner’s injury.
[5]         
To establish
a breach of a duty of care in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must first establish, with adequate
particularity, what the duty of
care was. This must be done in
reference to the prevailing standards of practice in the applicable field of
medicine: Ter Neuzen v. Korn, 1995 CanLII 72 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674, at para. 34. In this
case, there is little controversy about the applicable standard of care.
[6]         
The plaintiff
must next prove that the defendant did something in breach of that
standard of care.
[7]         
It is settled law that the onus of proving negligence always remains with the
plaintiff. There is, however, some nuance to this.
