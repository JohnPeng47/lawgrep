 The plaintiff, 1438767 Ontario Inc.
claims that it is the victim of a fraud carried out by its employee, Christina Giovinazzo.
The plaintiff brings a motion for summary judgment. The defendant, the Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) settled the action brought against it by the plaintiff with
the payment of $250,000. BNS also brings a motion for summary judgment on its
crossclaim against Ms. Giovinazzo.
[2]              
 Ms. Giovinazzo was hired as the plaintiff’s bookkeeper and
office manager in June 2014. Her duties included maintaining records with
respect to the services performed by independent truck owner and operators. During
the period she was employed with the plaintiff, Ms. Giovinazzo created fictitious
tickets for the amounts owing to drivers for hauling services. She fabricated
in excess of 130 account payables to two numbered companies. She prepared
cheques payable to the two companies and caused the plaintiff to issue the
cheques. After the cheques were signed, she deposited the cheques into her
personal bank account at the BNS.
[3]              
 As a result of her fraudulent scheme, a total of $279,409.55 was
paid into her account from June 2014 to January 2021. In January 2021, Ms.
Giovinazzo went on maternity leave. The fraud was discovered during her leave.
Her employment was terminated.
[4]              
 The plaintiff caused the Statement of Claim to be issued on
March 25, 2021. The defendants included Ms. Giovinazzo and the BNS. The
plaintiff brought a motion for a Mareva injunction. The motion came
before Justice Steele on April 9, 2021. She granted the injunction.
[5]              
 Ms. Giovinazzo delivered a Statement of Defence. The defence
contains a blanket denial without pleading any material facts. In the Mareva
injunction motion, Ms. Giovinazzo was cross-examined on her affidavit. She
testified that to supplement her income she created the cheques and deposited
them into her BNS account. She admitted that she created fictitious companies
and prepared cheques to the fictitious companies.
[6]              
  The plaintiff settled its action against BNS for $250,000.
[7]              
The plaintiff and BNS brought motions for summary judgment.  The
matter came before Justice Merritt in Civil Practice Court. She scheduled the
motion for November 20, 2024. Ms. Giovinazzo did not file any material in
accordance with the timetable. The plaintiff’s counsel sent several emails to
Ms. Giovinazzo but received no response. Ms. Giovinazzo did not attend the
motion.
[8]              
 The moving parties have put before the court compelling evidence
of Ms. Giovinazzo’s fraudulent activity. Ms. Giovinazzo admitted on
cross-examination that she created fictitious cheques and deposited the money
into her account. The bank records confirm the deposits. She did not deliver
any material in response to the motion for summary judgment and did not attend
the motion.
[9]              
 I find that Ms. Giovinazzo fabricated records and prepared
cheques payable to fictitious companies. She caused the plaintiff to issue the
cheques to the fictitious companies and she deposited the cheques into her
personal bank account.
[10]          
 I am satisfied that the facts support a finding of civil fraud.
There are four elements of the tort of civil fraud:
[11]          
 All four elements are made out in this case. The uncontroverted
evidence establishes that Ms. Giovinazzo created fake accounts and fictitious
tickets. She knew those representations were false and she made the
representations intentionally so she could supplement her income. The representations
caused the plaintiff to issue cheques for the fake payables.
[12]          
 The facts also support a finding of conversion. The essential
elements of the tort of conversion are:
[13]          
By causing the plaintiff to issue payments on fictitious payables
Ms. Giovinazzo converted a total of $279,409.55.
[14]          
 In the alternative, the plaintiff claims unjust enrichment. The
facts also support a finding of unjust enrichment. The elements of unjust
enrichment are:
[15]          
 Ms. Giovinazzo was enriched by
$279,409.55 which was the total amount of the fictitious cheques and payables. The
plaintiff was deprived of this amount without any juristic reason.
[16]          
 I am satisfied that the plaintiff and
BNS have established the liability of Ms. Giovinazzo.
[17]          
 The plaintiff has proven that the total
amount stolen by Ms. Giovinazzo was $279,409.55. The plaintiff settled with BNS
for $250,000. I award damages to the plaintiff in the amount of the balance of
$29,409.55. I award damages to BNS in the amount of $250,000.
[18]          
 The last fraudulent transfer was made by Ms. Giovinazzo on
January 22, 2021. The plaintiff seeks payment of prejudgment interest from this
date to the date of judgment.
[19]          
 The statement of claim was issued on March 25, 2021. The
applicable interest rate for actions commenced in the first quarter of 2021 is
0.5%. The period from March 25, 2021 to November 25, 2024 is 1341 days. The
total prejudgment interest rate is 1.84%. On damages of $279,409.55, the amount
of prejudgment interest is $5,132.72.
[20]          
 The BNS settled with the plaintiff with the payment of $250,000.
BNS is entitled to an award of prejudgment interest on this amount from the
date of the settlement. The amount is to be deducted from the amount of
prejudgment interest awarded to the plaintiff.  If there is no agreement as
between the plaintiff and BNS with respect to the allocation of prejudgment
interest as between them, they may request a case conference with me.
[21]          
 The plaintiff also seeks an award of punitive damages. BNS does
not seek an award of punitive damages in its notice of motion.
[22]          
Punitive damages may be awarded in exceptional cases for
“malicious, oppressive and high-handed” misconduct. The objective is to punish
the defendant rather than compensate the plaintiff: Whiten v. Pilot
Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 18, at para. 36.
[23]          
The principles to be applies when determining punitive damages
are:
[24]          
I find that Ms. Giovinazzo’s conduct justifies an award of
punitive damages. Over a five-year period, she organized a fraudulent scheme
that resulted in the transfer of $279,409.55. She took active steps to conceal
her conduct. I am satisfied that her conduct was high-handed, malicious and
reprehensible. I find that her conduct is particularly egregious because at the
time of the fraud she was in a position of trust as the plaintiff’s bookkeeper and
office manager. Although her conduct was reported to the police, she has not
faced any criminal penalties.
[25]          
 I award punitive damages to the plaintiff in the amount of
$100,000. I am satisfied that an award of punitive damages in this amount is
appropriate to punish Ms. Giovinazzo for her reprehensible conduct. Without an
award of punitive damages an inappropriate message would be sent to those
engaging in fraud, “that they may have no more to lose than paying back their
ill-gotten gains”: IBEW, Local 353 Trust Funds (Trustees of) v. Shojaei,
2014 ONSC 3656, at para. 16.
[26]          
 The plaintiff and BNS seek a declaration pursuant
to s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA)
that the judgment against Ms. Giovinazzo survives bankruptcy. The section reads
as follows:
[27]          
To be entitled to an order under s. 178 of the BIA,
the plaintiff must establish that Ms. Giovinazzo was acting in a fiduciary
capacity. The test for determining whether there is a fiduciary relationship is
as follows:
[28]          
Ms. Giovinazzo was the bookkeeper and office
manager of the plaintiff. She was responsible for all bookkeeping aspects of
the business. She was often entirely unsupervised. I am satisfied that as the
bookkeeper for the plaintiff’s business she was in a fiduciary relationship: Water
Matrix, supra; and Constantineau v. Squrrell, 2014 ONSC 4616;
Earhadt v. Kendrick, 2017 BCSC 813, at para. 28-29.
[29]          
I find that Ms. Giovinazzo is liable to the
plaintiff is fraud and embezzlement. I further find that the fraud occurred
while she was acting in a fiduciary capacity as the plaintiff’s bookkeeper and
office manager. I grant the order under s. 178(1) of the BIA that the
judgments in favour of the plaintiff and BNS survive any past, present or
future assignment in bankruptcy and that Ms. Giovinazzo shall not be released
by any discharge from bankruptcy. I am satisfied that this order is appropriate
in the circumstances of this case even though Ms. Giovinazzo has not yet
declared bankruptcy: University Plumbing v. Solstice Two Limited, 2019
ONSC 2242, at para. 23.
[30]          
The plaintiff and BNS are successful on this
motion and entitled to their costs. The plaintiff seeks its substantial
indemnity costs in the amount of $53,356.91, for counsel fee, inclusive of
H.S.T., and $2,693.34 for disbursements inclusive of H.S.T. The total amount claimed
is $56,050.25. BNS is seeking payment of its costs on a substantial indemnity
basis in the all-inclusive amount of $56,209.10, plus H.S.T. in the amount of
$7,223.06.
[31]          
A finding of fraud often results in an award of substantial indemnity
costs because it is a form of reprehensible conduct that warrants the court’s
disapproval: BH Frontier v. Canadian Choice Supply, 2022 ONSC 3707, at
para. 6. I find that Ms. Giovinazzo is liable to the plaintiff and BNS for her
fraudulent conduct. I am satisfied that the plaintiff and BNS are entitled to
their costs on a substantial indemnity basis.
[32]          
Section 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. C.43, provides the court with discretion in the determination of costs. In
fixing costs of the motion, I am not undertaking the same task as an assessment
officer or fixing costs with mathematical precision. I am to exercise my
discretion guided by the factors set out in R. 57.01 and having regard to the
overriding principles of reasonableness, fairness and proportionality. The
costs must be within the reasonable expectation of the unsuccessful party to
pay: Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004),
2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), (Boucher) at para. 38.
[33]          
I award costs to the plaintiff on a substantial indemnity basis
fixed in the all-inclusive amount of $50,000. I also award costs to BNS on a substantial
indemnity basis in the all-inclusive amount of $50,000. I am satisfied that an
award of costs in the amount of $50,000 to both the plaintiff and BNS is
proportionate, fair and within the reasonable expectations of Ms. Giovinazzo to
pay.
[34]          
For the reasons set out above I make the following order:
[35]          
The plaintiff and BNS may submit a draft judgment for my
consideration.
