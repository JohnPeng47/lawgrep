[1]           The defendant, Capitalplus Development
Group Ltd. (“Capitalplus”), brings this motion under the Construction Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. C.30 (“CA”) section 47 for an order discharging the claim for
lien registered by 2698368 Ontario Inc. (“269”) on the title to the subject
land, 105 Angus Drive Toronto (“the Angus Property”), returning the posted
security to Capitalplus and dismissing this action. There are two grounds for
the motion: there is no triable issue that 269 was an “owner” of the subject
land under the CA and therefore disqualified from preserving and
perfecting a lien; there is no triable issue that the bulk of the amount
claimed in this action is frivolous and vexatious as there is no evidence
supporting it.
[2]           In my decision in 2708320
Ontario Ltd. cob Viceroy Homes v. Jia Development Inc, 2023 ONSC 2301 (CanLII)
I described the process to be followed and the principles to be considered on
such a motion under section 47:
[3]           The following background facts were
evident from the motion material and are not disputed. Yang Yu is the principal
of 269. She worked with her son, Dylan Yu, a real estate agent. Ms. Yang used
another company of hers, 13289061 Canada Inc. (“132”), to obtain investments
and use them to purchase properties. Through 269, she would then refurbish the
properties and have 132 sell them at a profit. She often obtained loans from
Capitalplus to finance the renovation costs.
[4]           On May 28, 2022, Ms. Yang had 132 purchase
the Angus Property for $1 million (closing date of August 10, 2022) with a view
to refurbishing the house as a duplex and selling it at a profit. However, she
was unable to obtain the investments for the purchase. The closing was extended
to September 1, 2022.
[5]           On August 31, 2022, without lawyers, Ms.
Yang entered into an agreement with Capitalplus whereby Capitalplus agreed to assume
the purchase of the Angus Property. This agreement was entitled the “Renovation
& Purchase Agreement” (“RPA”). There was another agreement on August 31,
2022 whereby 132 assigned the agreement of purchase and sale to Capitalplus.
The sale closed the next day, September 1, 2023. A first mortgage securing a
loan to Capitalplus for part of the purchase price was registered.
[6]           In the RPA 269 promised to complete the
renovation at its own expense by March 3, 2023 and either repurchase it for
$1.2 million by March 7, or have “the parties” sell it to a third party by the
same date with Capitalplus taking the first $1.2 million of the proceeds of
sale and 269 the remainder.  The RPA specified that if Capitalplus “refused” to
sell to 269, 269 would be paid its renovation costs and could register a claim
for lien for same. There was a provision imposing a penalty of $500 per day if
the Angus Property was not sold by March 7, 2023. There was also a provision
that Capitalplus “shall not interfere with the renovation and design process.”
[7]           269 delayed the project. Ms. Yang in her
affidavit says that 269 incurred $328,085.89 in renovation costs and that the
delay was due to Capitalplus’ failure to provide 269 with “loans” for the renovation
costs. To help 269 finish, Capitalplus gave it “loans” totaling $56,110 in July
and August, 2023. However, by September 23, 2023, the renovation was only 60%
done. Frustrated, Capitalplus took over the work. It obtained a $250,000 loan
and spent $184,525.41 to finish. It paid off some lien claims as well.
[8]           On September 14, 2023 269 registered a
claim for lien in the amount of $271,975.89. On December 11, 2023 269 purported
to perfect its lien by commencing this action and registering a certificate of
action. Capitalplus delivered its statement of defence on January 17, 2024.
[9]           On February 7, 2024 Ms. Yang was
cross-examined pursuant to CA section 40 and gave several undertakings. In
this cross-examination, Ms. Yang admitted essentially that the relationship
between 269 and Capitalplus was that of a partnership. In her own words, she
called it a “collaboration or cooperation agreement.” She said that the two
“wanted to work together and to make money together.”
[10]       On April 11, 2024 Capitalplus obtained an
order vacating the 269 claim for lien by posting cash security of $339,969.87. This
facilitated the sale of the Angus Property to a third party on April 16, 2024 at
a price of $1.55 million. These sale proceeds covered the $1.2 million
Capitalplus stake plus its further costs.
[11]        On June 19, 2024 Capitalplus brought this
motion returnable September 3, 2024. At that time Mr. He appeared for 269 but
said he was “fired” and without instructions. I scheduled a removal motion for
him on October 3, 2024 and adjourned this motion to a date to be determined. On
October 3, 2024 Mr. He appeared and confirmed that there would be no removal
motion. I re-scheduled this motion. Capitalplus filed two affidavits sworn by a
director of Capitalplus, Jie Xing, and an affidavit sworn by Haopeng Shi, the
principal of a contractor on the project. Mr. Jie was cross-examined. 269 filed
an affidavit sworn by Ms. Yang.
[12]       It is trite law that an owner cannot lien
its own improved land as this would defeat the purpose of the CA namely
to provide security for those who supply services and materials to the
improvement. It would also be an inappropriate merger of interests with the
owner suing itself; see Big Creek Construction Ltd. v. York-Trillium
Development Group Ltd.), 1993 CanLII 9335 (ON SCDC) at para. 11.
[13]       An “owner”
is defined by section 1 of the CA as being any person with an interest
in the land at whose request and upon whose credit, or on whose behalf, or with
whose privity or consent, or for whose direct benefit an improvement is made.
The issue in this motion is whether 269 had an interest in the Angus Property.
[14]       If an improvement is made pursuant to a
partnership that owns the land, the partners that do the work are not
“contractors” who supply materials and services. They are “owners.” That
proposition was confirmed by Master Albert in her decision in Cohen v.
Brin, 2013 ONSC 1302 (CanLII). In paragraph 15 she stated that a
partnership has the following three ingredients: (1) a business, (2) carried on
in common, and (3) with a view to profit. She stated that partners can
contribute money, property, effort, knowledge, skill or other assets to the
common undertaking, a joint property interest and the sharing of profit. She
found in the case before her that the partner who did the work was an “owner”
and not a “contractor” and that he did not have a lien.
[15]       In the case
before me, there was in the end no issue that 269 was a “partner,” and
therefore an “owner,” when it did the renovation work. Mr. He frankly admitted
this in closing argument. That admission accorded with the evidence. Throughout
her section 40 cross-examination, Ms. Yang made admissions that clearly
establish that 269 was a partner and owner when it did the renovation work. As
stated earlier, Ms. Yang
called the RPA a “collaboration or cooperation agreement.” She also said that
the two parties “wanted to work together and to make money together.” Indeed, the
RPA gave 269 the equity on any sale to a third party and prohibited any
interference by Capitalplus in 269’s renovation and design. The payments
Capitalplus made to 269 were “loans,” not payment for services and materials.
These are the attributes of a partnership.
[16]       The issue raised
was a novel one. Mr. He argued that when it terminated the RPA in September,
2023 and denied 269 its stake in the eventual sale, Capitalplus turned 269 into
a “contractor” and, most importantly, did so retroactively in relation
to the renovation work already performed. Mr. He provided no authority for this
point.
[17]       I do not
accept it. There is no provision in the CA for such a retroactive
conversion of non-lienable work done by a partner into lienable work due to a post-work
dispute between the partners. CA section 14(1) confers the lien right
when the services and materials are supplied, not later. If the service and
materials were not lienable at the time of supply, they cannot be made lienable
by a later dispute. Also, Mr. He’s point would invite the abuses the
prohibition against owner liens was meant to avoid. Lien rights expire in real
time. Partners who supply services and materials would invariably register
claims for lien to protect their positions should there be future partner
disputes, thereby causing confusion and prejudicing bona fide lien
claimants.
[18]       There was also
some discussion about the provision in the RPA which purported to confer the
right to lien for the renovation costs onto 269 in the event Capitalplus
“refused” to sell to 269. There is nothing in the CA that allows the
parties by contract to confer lien rights where none exist. Indeed, the
opposite is the case. CA section 5(1) states that, “every contract or
subcontract related to an improvement is deemed to be amended in so far as is
necessary to be in conformity with this Act.” In my view, the RPA clause purporting
to confer lien rights on 269 for non-lienable work contradicts the CA and,
therefore, by virtue of CA section 5(1), is unenforceable.
[19]        For these
reasons, I declare that 269 does not have a lien and I order that the posted
Capitalplus security be returned to Capitalplus.
[20]       Mr. Chang did not argue that 269 had no
triable claim for breach of contract damages concerning its renovation costs per
se. This position makes sense given the evidence. The RPA specified that
269 would be entitled to be paid its renovation costs in the event Capitalplus
“refused” to sell to 269. Mr. Chang said that Capitalplus did not “refuse” to
sell the land to 269. Indeed, on October 18, 2023 Capitalplus offered to sell
the Angus Property to 269, an offer that was not responded to. However, the
price offered was $1.461 million, namely well above the price in the RPA. Also,
in the end Capitalplus sold the land to a third party for an amount just enough
to cover Capitalplus’ alleged costs and did so unilaterally. This issue is at
minimum triable.
[21]       Mr. Chang did argue though that the bulk
of the quantum of the 269 damage claim was frivolous and vexatious. He argued
that, despite the obligation to put its “best foot forward,” 269 provided
corroboration (ie. invoices, receipts, etc.) for only $126,376.31 of its total
claimed costs of $328,085.89. He pointed out that in her section 40
cross-examination Ms. Yang gave ten undertakings, some of which concerned proof
of the renovation costs. None of these undertakings are answered at this point.
Mr. Chang urged me to draw an adverse inference against 269 in this regard as a
result. He wanted me to reduce the damage claim to $70,266.31, being the
$126,376.31 less the $56,110 in “loans” Capitalplus paid to 269.
[22]       I am not prepared to find no triable issue
on this point. In her affidavit, Ms. Yang listed the costs 269 claims it
incurred. She attached the invoices for some of the claimed costs. She attached
photographs she said were taken of the project work as it was being done. This
showed considerable work. She attached the design for the project. She was not
cross-examined on her affidavit. In her section 40 cross-examination Ms. Yang
stated that 269 paid cash for most of its renovation costs. The fact that she
has not answered her undertakings will be taken into account on the issue of
costs; but I will not deny 269 its opportunity to prove the bulk of its breach
of contract damages on this basis.
[23]       I, therefore, deny this aspect of the
motion.
[24]       For these reasons, I declare that 269 does
not have lien and I order that the security posted by Capitalplus for the 269 claim
for lien be returned to Capitalplus, including interest accrued. I also order
that the remainder of the motion is dismissed.
[25]       Concerning costs, the parties filed costs
outlines. The Capitalplus costs outline shows $21,778.41 in partial indemnity
costs, $32,050.11 in substantial indemnity costs and $35,474.01 in full
indemnity costs. The 269 costs outline shows $11,996.65 in partial indemnity
costs and $19,093.05 in actual costs.
[26]       I encourage the parties to resolve the
issue of costs. If they cannot, Capitalplus must serve and file with my
Assistant Trial Coordinator written submission on costs of no more than two (2)
pages on or before March 3, 2025. 269 must then serve and file responding
written submission on costs of no more than two (2) pages on or before March
10, 2025. Any reply written submission on costs must be served and filed on or
before March 12, 2025. I will then render my decision on costs.
