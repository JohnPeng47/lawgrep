[1]               On April 12, 2024 Mr. Raybe pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.  The two counts arose out of incidents on August 8, 2021, and November 2, 2021.  On July 30, 2024, I sentenced Mr. Raybe to a global sentence of 7 years in the penitentiary, less pre-sentence custody.  I also imposed ancillary orders.  At the time I stated:
[2]               What follows are my full reasons for sentence.
[3]               On August 8, 2021 Mr. Raybe drove his white Ford Fusion to a carwash on Galloway Road in Scarborough, Toronto.  He arrived at about 5:48 pm.  He parked in the lot.  He then had an encounter with two men.  They went into a carwash bay.  One of the men produced a handgun.  Mr. Raybe had a confrontation with the other man.  They were both empty-handed.  The two men pushed each other.  Mr. Raybe then produced a gun from his right front pants pocket.  The man moved away from Mr. Raybe.  Mr. Raybe fired the gun twice, towards Galloway Road.  He then left the scene in his Ford Fusion.
[4]               Residents in the Galloway Road area contacted 911.  Toronto Police officers arrived on scene.  The police found two shell casings.  One of the rounds struck a residential fence.  There is no evidence that the other two men fired shots.  Mr. Raybe was not known to the police.  Much of the incident was caught on surveillance video but the police could not identify the shooter at that time.  An internal bulletin was circulated with the Toronto Police about the identity of the shooter.
[5]               On November 2, 2021 Mr. Raybe was driving his Ford Fusion on Bellamy Road in Scarborough.  An unidentified grey car approached Mr. Raybe’s car.  As the unidentified car pulled up someone in that car (or more than one person) fired gunshots towards Mr. Raybe’s car.  Mr. Raybe shot back.  He used the same gun he had used during the August 2021 gunfight.  Multiple bullets struck the Ford Fusion.  Mr. Raybe was shot in the left shoulder.
[6]               Mr. Raybe then drove himself to Scarborough General Hospital.  When he got out of the car, a woman named Zyann Brown exited the front passenger seat of the Ford Fusion.  Ms. Brown removed certain items from the Ford Fusion.  She then met with one Kyandre Pessoa.  Mr. Pessoa was driving an SUV.  Mr. Pessoa then left his vehicle, got into the Ford Fusion, and drove it away.  Ms. Brown drove the SUV away.
[7]               Mr. Pessoa was stopped by the police a short distance away from the hospital.  The investigating officers observed four shell casings in the Ford Fusion.  The police seized the vehicle but released Mr. Pessoa at the scene.
[8]               Investigating officers attended Scarborough General Hospital.  They subsequently arrested Mr. Raybe for the November 21 firefight.  One of the officers felt that Mr. Raybe seemed familiar.  He then reviewed the surveillance from the August 2021 incident.  The officer correctly concluded that Mr. Raybe was indeed the same person who fired the two rounds during the August 2021 incident. He also correctly concluded that the Ford Fusion in the August 2021 incident was the same vehicle in the November 2021 incident.
[9]               On May 29, 2022 the York Regional Police investigated Mr. Pessoa.  He was in possession of a Taurus 9mm handgun.  The police forensically analyzed the weapon.  It matched the shell casings found from the August and November 2021 incidents.
[10]           I have reviewed a pre-sentence report that was prepared for Mr. Raybe.  He was 21 years old when I passed sentence but turned 22 in September.  He was born in Jamaica and came to this country at age 11.  He lived with his father, older sister, and niece.  He is a permanent resident.  He will likely be deported as a result of these offences.  His mother still resides in Jamaica and is a homemaker.  His father lives in Toronto and works at an auto parts factory.
[11]           Mr. Raybe told the probation officer that he was raised in Jamaica by his mother.  They lived in impoverished circumstances.  The relationship between his father and his mother ended in 2007 when he was five years old.  He stated that he has not seen his mother in ten years, and he is very emotional about it.  He has been unable to visit her in Jamaica.  He described a relationship with his father that was “okay” but stated that his closest relationship is with his sister.  None of the members of his family has had contact with the criminal justice system.
[12]           According to one of his high school teachers, Mr. Raybe is very resentful that his mother could not care for him in Jamaica and had to send him to Canada.  She was aware that his relationship with his father is not ideal.  Mr. Raybe described the neighbourhood he has lived in as very violent with a great deal of crime; his father does not entirely agree with that assessment.  Mr. Raybe noted that he has lost friends to violence.
[13]           Mr. Raybe was in a relationship that has recently produced a daughter.  He told the probation officer that he gets along well with the mother of his child.  He cares for her every day while her mother works, although he did not want the mother of his child to be consulted for the report.  His teacher noted that Mr. Raybe had been streamed into the non-academic level.  She said that this was common for Black boys.  She felt that it was unfair, and in Mr. Raybe’s case he was bright enough to go to university.  She also said he was not a behavioural problem in class and should not have been streamed away from the academic level.  She reported that he had been accepted to Ryerson University (as it was then known) but had been unable to attend for financial reasons.  That was not quite what Mr. Raybe told the probation officer.  He said that he had never applied to university or college.
[14]           Mr. Raybe reported to the probation officer that he has worked as a janitor, and at a call centre.  He did not provide any proof of employment.  Substance abuse does not appear to be significant a problem for him, although he has experimented with different substances.  He did report that systemic racism affected him in school and that he tries to stay away from the police because he knows how they work.
[15]           In terms of his education, Mr. Raybe reported that he has graduated from high school and finished in the honour roll.  He does not, however, have his diploma.  His teacher noted that he appears to be missing one credit and this is likely the reason he has not received his diploma.  She was making enquiries about whether guidance counsellors had not advised Mr. Raybe correctly.
[16]           Mr. Raybe told the probation officer that he is not involved with a gang; that information was contradicted by Detective Constable Sarjoo of Guns and Gangs, who indicated that Mr. Raybe is an associate of the MNE gang.  The Crown did not seek to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Raybe is, or was, a member of a criminal gang.  That said, videos filed by the Crown suggest that Mr. Rabye at the least associates with gang members and displays things associated with criminal gangs and criminal gang activities. Those things include hand signs, cash and guns. As I note later in these reasons, those things affect the degree of mitigation for the guilty plea and Mr. Raybe’s prospects for rehabilitation. The probation officer assessed – and it is plainly correct – that Mr. Raybe has been affected by negative peer associations.  He also appears to have issues with poor decisions, financial management, and problem-solving.  The probation officer also assessed that at the time of the two shootings, Mr. Raybe was living a “high-risk lifestyle”.  The probation officer recommended trauma counselling and other counselling to assist him.
[17]           Mr. Raybe’s friend Adrian Lawrence works at the Scarborough Village Recreation Centre.  He provided a letter of support.  He said that Mr. Raybe has the potential to be a good citizen, and that he is very remorseful about his actions.  He says that Mr. Raybe understands that his poor life decisions are what caused him to commit these crimes and therefore shows some insight.
[18]           Mr. Raybe’s sister Thalia Raybe also wrote a letter of support.  She says that her brother has grown and transformed.  The birth of his daughter has especially influenced him.  Ms. Raybe says that he has transformed himself into a compassionate, responsible family man.
[19]           The first charge involved a gunfight on the streets of Toronto.  And so did the second.  The first shootout was initiated by Mr. Raybe; the second was not, but he was an enthusiastic participant.  This court has emphasized time and time again that handguns are a pernicious problem in our city.  Many innocents have been killed and injured.  Many people living a criminal lifestyle – primarily young men – carry handguns and use them on each other.  That is no less tragic – it means the end of what might have been promising lives.  Mr. Raybe, it appears, was living such a lifestyle and did exactly that.  It is miraculous that on the two occasions where he fired his handgun that nobody was killed or injured.  I agree with the statement of my colleague K. Campbell J. in R. v. St. Clair, 2018 ONSC 7028 at para. 47:
[20]           Possession of a loaded prohibited handgun contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code currently carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.  At the time of the offence, however, it carried a maximum sentence of 10 years.  Parliament has increased the penalty.  Of course, Mr. Raybe is only liable for the lesser punishment.
[21]           Mr. Shumka’s position on behalf of the Crown is that Mr. Raybe should be sentenced to 8 years on each firearm, with the sentences to be served concurrently.  Each offence on its own, since it involved a shooting, could well attract a sentence in the range of 7-8 years.  The principles of totality and restraint, as well as the mitigating factors of Mr. Raybe’s age, anti-Black racism, and the guilty plea, militate a more moderate sentence.
[22]           Mr. McGregor submits that the proper range of sentence is 5-6 years globally, less pre-sentence custody.  He points to all the same factors that the Crown points should mitigate the harshness of a lengthy sentence.  For example, Mr. Raybe was 18 at the time of the first offence and the PSR details his difficult history.
[23]           The most important mitigating factor in this case is that Mr. Raybe pleaded guilty.  That mitigation has some limits in this case.  Mr. Raybe pleaded guilty on the day set for his trial in the face of an extremely strong Crown case.  Given the post-Covid backlog in our courts, and the saving of judicial resources, it was still welcome and is a proper mitigating factor.
[24]           A guilty plea is an expression of remorse.  That expression of remorse, however, has limits in this case.  Mr. Raybe did submit a letter of apology.  He pointed out, and I accept this, that he was “young and dumb” when this happened.  He also says that his life has changed, and his outlook has changed, with the birth of his baby girl.  That is not the end of the story, however.  The Crown submitted several TikTok music videos.  Mr. Raybe appears in them.  In one video, he is wielding a handgun.  There are multiple references to shooting the firearms.  In another video he refers to getting a head blown off and a GPS monitor.  In another video he there are large amounts of cashed displayed, and in yet another video a warning about defending territory.
[25]           As Mr. Shumka acknowledged, there are difficulties with using these TikTok videos.  It is unclear when they were posted.  As well, while they may show gang affiliation or motivation, they are interpreted by many people as a form of art.  I do not need to wade into that debate.  The Crown does not seek to show that Mr. Raybe is the member of a gang.  The Crown’s position – and I agree – is that the TikTok videos show Mr. Raybe holding guns, pantomiming the holding of guns, and making reference to the use of guns.  Whether or not these videos are considered to be art, they do call into question whether Mr. Raybe has truly rejected the use of guns.  That calls into question his prospects for rehabilitation and creates a need for specific deterrence.  I acknowledge that he likely created or was involved in these videos before he spent time reflecting on his crimes, and before the birth of his baby girl.  I therefore give them some limited weight.
[26]           Other mitigating factors include Mr. Raybe’s youth, lack of criminal record, and difficult upbringing.  I accept that Mr. Raybe has been subject to systemic racism and I accept that as a mitigating factor: R. v. Morris, 2021 ONCA 680.
[27]           There are also several significant aggravating factors in this case.  The key aggravating factor is obviously the fact that both incidents involved the discharge of a firearm.  I am satisfied of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.
[28]           I also find Mr. Raybe’s actions during both incidents highly aggravating.
[29]           During the first incident, he started shooting first.  There was no element of self-defence. During the second incident, it is true that he was shot at, but he made no attempt to escape.  He shot at a moving car from another moving car.  It is impossible to overstate how dangerous that is.  Life is not a James Bond movie and Mr. Raybe is not a Navy SEAL.  His chances of hitting a moving target were tiny.  His chances of hitting a bystander were high.
[30]           In both cases, Mr. Raybe fired a gun in a residential area.  The consequences of doing so could have been devastating and it is only a matter of luck that he did not kill or seriously injure someone.
[31]           A sentence must reflect the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.  The important principles of sentencing involving the possession of a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm are general and specific deterrence, and denunciation.  For all the reasons that I have mentioned, the courts must deter the possession of handguns and denounce the crime when it occurs.  This sentencing principle is actualized through the mechanism of exemplary sentences: R. v. Mohammed, 2017 ONCA 691 at para. 6.  Absent exceptional circumstances, the range for possession of a loaded prohibited handgun is generally in the range of 3 years where the possession of the gun is a true crime or being used as the tool of an illegal trade, and not a mere regulatory infraction: R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677at para. 109; R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15 at para. 82.
[32]           Balanced against the necessity of general and specific deterrence, and denunciation, is the need for restraint where a young, racialized first offender is before the court.  It is also a principle of sentencing that a sentencing judge should consider sanctions other than incarceration for youthful first offenders: R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.).  I do take into account Mr. Raybe’s youth and his status as a first offender.  That said, offences involving possession of a firearm, and discharging a firearm, require exemplary sentences: R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15 at para. 5.  Deterrence and denunciation remain the primary sentencing principles with cases involving firearms, and particularly the discharge of a firearm.  The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in that case.  As Doherty J.A. stressed in the Court of Appeal in R. v. Nur, supra, at para. 206, the most important sentencing principle in firearms cases is general deterrence:
[33]           The most important principles where a firearm is discharged are also general deterrence and denunciation.  The usual range is between 7 and 11 years: R. v. Belissimo, 2009 ONCA 49 at paras. 3-5; R. v. Dhaliwal, 2019 ONCA 398 at paras. 2-4.
[34]           I am aware that there will be collateral consequences to this sentencing.  Mr. Raybe will likely be deported.  I take that into account but were I to impose a sentence that would allow him to appeal any immigration finding (as I understand it, less than 6 months) it would result in a sentence that is manifestly unfit.
[35]           I am also aware that Mr. Raybe spent time on house arrest before his bail conditions were loosened.  Unfortunately, after he pleaded guilty but was still on bail he was arrested while breaching one of his bail conditions.  He was outside his residence, after hours, and was in a car going away from his residence.  I revoked his bail, held a new bail hearing, and allowed him out on stricter conditions.  Given his disregard for his bail conditions, I am disinclined to grant him any Downes credit.
[36]           Another important principle is totality.  A court must avoid imposing a sentence that is so crushing as to destroy any hope of rehabilitation.  Consecutive sentences in the range of 7 or 8 years would not be out of the range of sentence for these offenses and would be proportionate to the gravity of the offences.  When applied to a young first offender – Mr. Raybe was 18 and, as he put it, young and dumb – such a sentence would offend the totality principle.
[37]           Accordingly, I find that a global sentence of 7 years is fit.  This sentence is at the low end of the range under the circumstances, but reflects the mitigation of the guilty plea, the principles of rehabilitation, restraint, and totality, and still is severe enough to reflect the principles of denunciation and deterrence.
[38]           As noted, on the indictment involving the August 2021 conviction, I sentenced Mr. Raybe to 3 ½ years in the penitentiary.  On the indictment involving the November 2021 conviction, I sentenced Mr. Raybe to 3 ½ years in the penitentiary, consecutive to the sentence on the August 2021 offence, less credit for pre-sentence custody.  Mr. Raybe spent 23 days in custody; he is thus credited with 35 days at the enhanced rate of 1.5:1: Criminal Code, s. 719(3.2). Thus, Mr. Raybe had 3 years, 4 months, and 25 years left to be served on that count.  I also imposed a s. 109 order for 10 years on the August 2021 conviction, and a s. 109 order for life on the November 2021 conviction.  I also imposed a DNA order on the August 2021 conviction.
