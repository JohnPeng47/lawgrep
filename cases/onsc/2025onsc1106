[1]              
The Applicant, Pasquale Mancuso, brings a motion
to change a final order from 2016.  The Respondent, Silvana Logullo, objects,
and requests relief of her own.
[2]              
After marrying in 1991 and separating in 2014, the
parties divorced in 2016. Mr. Mancuso has remarried.
[3]              
The parties have two adult children, Alissa and Daniel. 
When the couple separated, only Daniel was a dependent child of the marriage.  At
the time of this trial, Daniel was twenty-five years old.  He has always lived
with his mother.
[4]              
On August 24, 2016, the parties settled their
dispute via a consent order which included the following terms:
[5]              
The Applicant filed a motion to change on
November 16, 2022.
[6]              
Both parties attack the other’s credibility and,
as a result, ask the court to draw separate adverse inferences.
[7]              
The parties are self-represented.  They worked
diligently throughout the trial.  Despite the difficult topics covered, they were
professional and cooperative.
[8]              
Due to a hearing disability, the Respondent was
assisted by captioners.  The court thanks them for their work.
[9]              
Mr. Mancuso wishes to change the spousal support
provisions.  He denies he is in arrears of child support or section 7 expenses.
[10]          
Mr. Mancuso says he has been denied information
about Ms. Logullo and Daniel.  He has paid support faithfully in accordance with
the original order.  He has not paid section 7 expenses because, despite
numerous requests, he never received adequate information.
[11]          
Mr. Mancuso acknowledges that his income has
increased.  In 2023 he earned $167,939.64.  He claims he provided evidence of
his income every year.  He says that Ms. Logullo never sought to change the
support provisions until he reached out in 2021 seeking to confirm Daniel’s
post-secondary expenses.
[12]          
Mr. Mancuso objects to paying for special math
courses that Daniel took in high school, instead of the monthly tutoring
specifically mentioned in the order.
[13]          
Mr. Mancuso argues that Daniel’s post-secondary
expenses have been improperly calculated.  He says that Daniel’s tuition tax
credits must be subtracted from any amount he has to pay.  He objects to paying
for courses from which Daniel withdrew too late for a refund or needed to
repeat.
[14]          
Mr. Mancuso suffers from atrial fibrillation and
is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  During the trial, this
condition caused him to be short of breath and dizzy.  Mr. Mancuso says his
deteriorating health makes it necessary for him to begin planning for
retirement.
[15]          
Mr. Mancuso denies that Ms. Logullo has a compensatory
spousal support claim; and says that because she has masked her financial
situation, her need is impossible to determine.
[16]          
Mr. Mancuso believes that Ms. Logullo has had
and continues to have unreported income. He asks that income be imputed to her
for the purpose of calculating any ongoing spousal support.
[17]          
Mr. Mancuso says that Ms. Logullo has falsely
accused him of abuse, harassment, and invasion of privacy.
[18]          
Finally, Mr. Mancuso claims that Ms. Logullo has
engaged in “the tort of conspiracy” because of the way she has structured ownership
of her house as a co-tenancy between her and Daniel.   This allegation, for
which he does not seek damages, is not raised in his motion to change.  Nor is
it listed in the Trial Schedule Endorsement Form.   As it is not properly
before the court, this claim shall not be considered.
[19]          
Ms. Logullo seeks retroactive and ongoing
spousal support, and child support arrears.  Initially, she also sought a
restraining order but appeared to abandon that request at trial.  In any event,
Ms. Logullo did not make sufficient arguments for a restraining order. I
decline to consider it further.
[20]          
Ms. Logullo has been hamstrung in her efforts to
get information from the Applicant.  She denies that he sent her annual income
tax returns.  She seeks retroactive support reflecting his increased income.
[21]          
Ms. Logullo acknowledges that her own income
improved after the Final Order.  She uses her T1 reported income to calculate
support under the SSAG.
[22]          
Ms. Logullo believes that Mr. Mancuso has not
fully reported his own income, and asks that this be taken into account when
determining any support.  For the purposes of this trial, I treat this as a
request to impute income to him.
[23]          
Ms. Logullo has her own health challenges.  Ms.
Logullo has been hearing impaired (“complete diagnosed deafness”) deafness for
over twenty years.  Due to her condition, she was placed on short-term leave
from her position as a developmental support worker with the York Regional
District School Board.  She has since been approved for long-term disability
which she expects to garner her an income of $45,000 per year.
[24]          
Ms. Logullo is amenable to terminating spousal
support on January 1, 2031.  She asks for ongoing spousal support consistent
with the formula outlined in the Final Order.
[25]          
Ms. Logullo agrees that Daniel withdrew from
university in April 2022, and is no longer a dependent child of the marriage. 
She says the Applicant owes retroactive section 7 expenses from the date of the
Final Order until Daniel’s withdrawal from university.
[26]          
Ms. Logullo believes that the Applicant invaded
her privacy by discovering where she lived when she had sought to keep that
information from him.  She alleges “emotional and financial abuse” throughout
the marriage.
[27]          
Mr. Mancuso brought this case as a motion to
change, seeking to terminate spousal support when he turns 63 so that he can
retire.
[28]          
Ms. Logullo originally sought increased spousal
support to compensate for the termination of child support.  She seeks
retroactive spousal support based on Mr. Mancuso’s income in the relevant
years, and arrears for section 7 expenses.
[29]          
Over the course of the trial, the parties agreed
on the following:
[30]          
As a result, it is not necessary to determine
whether the Applicant’s health represents a material change of circumstances.
[31]          
Both parties made arguments and introduced
evidence about numerous events prior to the Final Order.  Since neither made a
motion to change the order under Rule 25(19) of the Family Law Rules –
for example, based on fraud or a mistake – these arguments and materials are mostly
irrelevant.
[32]          
Therefore, the issues to be decided are:
[33]          
My conclusions are as follows:
[34]          
My findings of fact, reached on a balance of
probabilities, are contained in the following analysis.  I first discuss credibility
followed by some general findings of fact.  I then discuss each issue,
outlining the relevant law, the parties’ evidence and my conclusions.
[35]          
Credibility is a primary vehicle for determining
the truth of alleged facts.  This task can be rendered “unenviably difficult”
depending on the narrative put forward by the parties: Konstan v. Berkovits,
2023 ONSC 497, 2023 CarswellOnt 932 at para. 8.
[36]          
In R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006]
1 S.C.R. 621 at para. 20, the Supreme Court
of Canada cautioned that evaluating witness credibility is not “a science.”
[37]          
Traditional criteria used to assess witness
evidence include witness demeanour, inherent probability in the circumstances,
and internal and external consistency: Prodigy Graphics Group Inc. v.
Fitz-Andrews, [2000] O.T.C. 237, at para. 46 per
Justice Cameron.
[38]          
Witness credibility is critical to the burden of
proof: Konstan.  Where a party has the burden to discharge a legal onus,
I must satisfy myself, on a balance of probabilities, of “the credibility and
reliability of the evidence in order to be in a position to make the relevant
findings of fact”: Konstan at para. 9.
[39]          
It is necessary to distinguish credibility from
reliability.  Credibility has to do with whether parties’ testimony is honest,
while reliability concerns whether testimony is accurate: R. v. Sanichar,
2013 SCC 4, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 54, at para. 19.  One may find a witness generally
credible yet doubt their reliability.  Conversely, a witness who is not
credible may nonetheless offer reliable testimony.
[40]          
Both parties were credible.  They gave their
testimony in a straightforward manner. While they made reasonable concessions
on cross-examination, their testimony remained consistent throughout the
trial.  Generally, they were not evasive.
[41]          
In contrast, and as discussed further in these
reasons, I do not always find the parties reliable.
[42]          
In this case, the issues come down to the
sufficiency of the evidence and the degree to which that evidence meets the
relevant legal tests.  Understandably, although they did make efforts, the
parties were less equipped to present legal arguments.
[43]          
After the 2016 final order, Mr. Mancuso appears
to have first reached out to Ms. Logullo for some information in September of
2017.  It appears that nothing was provided until January of 2018 when Ms.
Logullo’s then lawyer, Peter Smith, emailed Mr. Mancuso about Daniel’s section
7 expenses.
[44]          
Mr. Mancuso spent some time documenting this
exchange, which shows that Mr. Smith had a tenuous grasp of the parties’
situation.  For example, he was under the impression that a final order had not
been taken out.   He also did not initially credit Daniel’s OSAP grants in his
section 7 expenses, something he later acknowledged made a “large difference”
to Mr. Mancuso’s obligations.
[45]          
Based on the emails between the two, and Mr.
Mancuso’s testimony, I am persuaded of the following:
[46]          
There was no further communication between the
parties until October 19, 2021, when Mr. Mancuso emailed Ms. Logullo directly
to “respectfully ask for an update on Daniel’s progression through
post-secondary education.”  He ended this short message with the sentence:
“Please note that we have enjoyed some years of peace and I would hope that we can
continue to do so.”
[47]          
Ms. Logullo says she took the above sentence as
a “threat”.  I am not persuaded that it was.  However, both parties were
suspicious of the other and, thus, not inclined to negotiate directly.  Ms.
Logullo responded in January 2022, reiterating her claim for Daniel’s section 7
expenses.  She also advised Mr. Mancuso that “due to personal safety concerns,
I will not be disclosing or sharing mine/Daniel’s home address.”
[48]          
Mr. Mancuso filed his motion to change in 2023.
[49]          
Because each believed the other was not
operating in good faith, the parties were unable to communicate productively. 
Mr. Mancuso was upset about his estrangement from Daniel. Ms. Logullo felt she
was being shortchanged, and that Mr. Mancuso was prying into her private life.
[50]          
Ms. Logullo characterizes the marriage as
abusive, especially after she suffered profound bi-lateral sensorineural
hearing loss with tinnitus and vertigo. I appreciate that the relationship was
fraught for many years prior to separation.  I believe that Ms. Logullo felt
unsupported and isolated.  After listening carefully to her arguments, I am not
persuaded that the relationship was abusive.  Nor did it feature “family
violence” as that term is defined in the Divorce Act.
[51]          
Ms. Logullo made a police complaint in August
2024.  There is no evidence that this ever resulted in charges.  I believe Mr.
Mancuso’s testimony that the police never approached him about this incident.
[52]          
I am persuaded that Ms. Logullo went to the
police in 2024 because she was unsettled by the idea that Mr. Mancuso knew
where she lived.
[53]          
I am not persuaded that Mr. Mancuso acted
wrongly in trying to verify Ms. Logullo’s address – something she had refused
to disclose.  By 2024, Ms. Logullo had responded to Mr. Mancuso’s motion to
change by making a claim for extended spousal support.  She also filed a
Financial Statement in which she reported owning a house in a tenancy-in-common
with Daniel in which he had a 99% interest. Given her spousal support claim, it
was not unreasonable for Mr. Logullo to try to verify the nature of the
residence in which she was claiming only a 1% interest.
[54]          
Neither party addressed the legal test for
imputation, but both allege that the other has hidden income. They each bear
the burden of proving their allegations on a balance of probabilities.
[55]          
Where a party fails to
provide full financial disclosure relating to their income, the court is
entitled to draw an adverse inference and to impute income to them. See: Szitas
v. Szitas, 2012 ONSC 1548; Woofenden v. Woofenden, 2018 ONSC 4583.
[56]          
Ms. Logullo has a college diploma in social work. 
Until July 2022 she was a member of the Ontario College of Social Workers and
Social Service Workers.  She has since resigned from the College.   Most
recently, Ms. Logullo has been employed by the York Region District School
Board as a developmental support worker.
[57]          
Mr. Mancuso makes three principal allegations
against Ms. Logullo.
[58]          
First, based on what he calls “non payroll
deposits” into her bank account, Mr. Mancuso seeks to impute 50 percent of the
following amounts to Ms. Logullo’s income:
[59]          
Second, Mr. Mancuso alleges that Ms. Logullo
failed to disclose a lip-reading business called Speechread.com that she had
started prior to 2015.  He introduced a news article dated February 19, 2015, from
the online news site YorkRegion.com that, he says, substantiates his claim that
Ms. Logullo had a thriving business.  He alleges that Speechread.com’s website
was only taken down a month after a divorce application was filed.
[60]          
Mr. Mancuso introduced screenshots from the
website LinkedIn that, he says, he downloaded “sometime in 2021”.   He claims
that they show Ms. Logullo initially had an entry for Speechread.com that she
later removed.  He claims that all of this is highly suspicious.  The dates on
which this information was actually posted to LinkedIn could not be verified.
[61]          
Third, Mr. Mancuso invites the court to draw an
adverse inference from how Ms. Logullo treats her residence located at 11
Crieff Avenue:
[62]          
Ms. Logullo says the following in response.
[63]          
First, the bank account from which Mr. Mancuso
has pulled what he deems suspicious deposits is shared with Daniel.   Because
of that, Ms. Logullo redacted information about deposits that Daniel made.
[64]          
Second, Ms. Logullo testified that she has
always reported all income, including business income, to Revenue Canada.  As
an example, she pointed to a Statement of Business or Professional Activities
in her 2019 tax return showing income of $1200.
[65]          
Third, with respect to her residence, Ms.
Logullo denied that she is hiding assets.  She did not disclose her home
address because she is uncomfortable with Mr. Mancuso having that knowledge. She
said that she decided to give Daniel a 99 percent interest in the home as a
personal decision.  At trial, Ms. Logullo acknowledged that she is the primary
contributor to the home.  She also acknowledged that she had not obtained a
current professional assessment of its value.
[66]          
Under cross-examination, Ms. Logullo said:
[67]          
My findings are as follows:
[68]          
During the marriage Mr. Mancuso was an
automotive technician.  He was exposed to toxic substances and suffered health effects.
[69]          
Ms. Logullo says that this proceeding has been
characterized by the Applicant’s chronic refusal to disclose information.  She
points to what she says are discrepancies in his pay stubs, namely, high
taxable benefits that appear on his monthly pay stubs which are not reflected
in his year-end salary statement.  She alleges that his financial statement
inflates his expenditures, such as an average of $850 a month on groceries that
cannot be verified from his credit cards.  Finally, she argues that she has no
information about Mr. Mancuso’s wife’s finances with whom he owns various
investments.
[70]          
Under cross-examination, Mr. Mancuso testified
as follows:
[71]          
I find as follows:
[72]          
As neither party has proven their claim against
the other on a balance of probabilities, their respective requests to impute
income are dismissed.
[73]          
For clarity, the parties’ income, based on their
respective notices of assessment, is as follows:
[74]          
The parties agree that Daniel was a dependent
child of the marriage until April 30, 2022.  Mr. Mancuso was obligated to pay
table child support until that date.  I did not understand Mr. Mancuso to dispute
this.  Rather, he argues that Ms. Logullo’s refusal to deal directly with him
made it impossible for him to update their financial arrangements.  He also
claims that he has overpaid her spousal support which should be set off against
any arrears.
[75]          
Mr. Mancuso’s argument about overpayment of
spousal support is partly based on his claim of undisclosed income and partly
based on the change in Ms. Logullo’s income.  In Issue One, I dismissed the
argument for imputed income.  I also fault both parties for the failures in
communication over the years.  Consequently, I do not accept that Mr. Mancuso is
owed a credit for any potential overpayment of spousal support.
[76]          
Mr. Mancuso did not offer any other information
about his child support arrears.  Having reviewed her calculations, on a
balance of probabilities I accept Ms. Logullo’s submissions as to the amounts
owing, which are set out below and include credit for overpayments after April,
2022:
[77]          
As a result, Mr. Mancuso owes the following
amounts:
[78]          
Mr. Mancuso testified that he provided proof of
his income every year.  Nevertheless, he was aware that his income had
increased.  He had an obligation to ensure that his child support payments – which
are the right of the child, not the recipient spouse – were up to date.  I find
he did not make sufficient efforts in this regard.
[79]          
I therefore find that Mr. Mancuso has been in
default of this obligation.  He shall pay 2% interest on the above-noted amounts
from the final date on which each amount was owing, ie., December 31 of the
relevant year.
[80]          
Under the Final Order Mr. Mancuso must pay his
proportionate share of “the Special and Extraordinary Expenses of the child”. 
At the time, this expense was “a Tutor of approximately $200 per month.”  In
addition, the parties were responsible for 50% of post-secondary expenses in
proportion to their incomes.
[81]          
Section 7(3) of the Federal Child Support
Guidelines states that “in determining the amount of an expense referred to
in subsection (1), the court must take into account any subsidies, benefits or
income tax deductions or credits relating to the expense, and any eligibility
to claim a subsidy, benefit or income tax deduction or credit relating to the
expense.”
[82]          
Ms. Logullo claims the following categories of
section 7 expenses:
[83]          
Ms. Logullo provided the following chart for
item (b), immediately above:
[84]          
An unfortunate aspect of this case is that Mr.
Mancuso is estranged from Daniel.  I accept that this has made it challenging
for him to get information about Daniel’s expenses.
[85]          
Mr. Mancuso admits that he has not paid any
section 7 expenses for Daniel since separation.
[86]          
Mr. Mancuso says that he paid child support for
years “in a complete vacuum of information”.  As detailed earlier, in 2018 Mr.
Mancuso corresponded with a lawyer retained by Ms. Logullo to follow up on
section 7 expenses.  He says that the lawyer’s calculations “were riddled with
mistakes and information”.  As a result, he became “frustrated”, in addition to
being “consumed” by the death of his father.
[87]          
Mr. Mancuso introduced a chart, prepared by him,
showing the various amounts Daniel paid in tuition and books.  In those
calculations:
[88]          
As a result, Mr. Mancuso argues that Daniel has
had no net post-secondary expenses and, therefore, there are no arrears.
[89]          
In order to decide whether to accept Mr.
Mancuso’s calculations, it is necessary to determine whether he is entitled to
subtract from his share of expenses, Daniel’s tuition tax credits, course
refunds Daniel should have but did not receive due to his own inadvertence or
carelessness, and fees for failed or repeated courses.
[90]          
The Final Order does not speak to this question.
[91]          
Mr. Mancuso says that under section 7(3) of the CSG
he is entitled to deduct any tuition tax credits Daniel received.  As noted
above, that subsection states that in determining the amount of an expense a
court “must” consider any income tax deductions or credits.
[92]          
Mr. Mancuso did not, however, mention section 3
of the CSG which states in part:
[93]          
In other words, while section 7(3) of the CSG
provides a presumptive rule for calculating section 7 expenses, section 3(2) gives
the court the discretion to depart from that rule if the court finds that applying
the rule is inappropriate.
[94]          
For the following reasons, I find that it would
be inappropriate to reduce the amount of Mr. Mancuso’s section 7 expenses by
the amount that Daniel received in tuition credits:
[95]          
Mr. Mancuso does not want to contribute to courses
that Daniel withdrew from too late to secure a refund.  At various points
during the trial, he also suggested that he should not contribute to courses
that Daniel had to repeat and/or failed, although his calculations on this
point are not entirely clear.  I will deal with these claims together.
[96]          
One can understand Mr. Mancuso’s frustration at
having to pay for expenses that he regards as thrown away.  However, his argument
essentially is that a parent’s share of post-secondary expenses should decrease
if their child encounters difficulties.  There is no caselaw before this court to
support this position, which I find unacceptably narrow in any event.  The suggested
approach promotes an analysis that is backward-looking, injects uncertainty
into parents’ proportionate sharing of section 7 expenses, and, quite possibly,
incentivizes litigation.
[97]          
While any parent reasonably hopes that their
child will succeed at university, success is never guaranteed.
[98]          
For all these reasons, I do not accept Mr.
Mancuso’s calculations that he owes nothing towards Daniel’s university
education.
[99]          
I am persuaded on a balance of probabilities
that Mr. Mancuso has an obligation to share in the following section 7
expenses:
[100]      
Ms. Logullo says that Mr. Mancuso owes 2% interest
on all these amounts from the moment they were owing.
[101]      
Here, it is important to note the following:
[102]      
In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that it
is appropriate to award any prejudgment interest for the period before Ms.
Mancuso filed her response to the motion to change.
[103]      
Mr. Mancuso therefore owes $10,012,12 plus
prejudgment interest of 2% as of March 13, 2023.
[104]      
The Respondent argues that she is owed
retroactive spousal support for the years 2017 onwards.  She makes this claim
because of the Applicant’s increased income.
[105]      
The Applicant objects because he thinks the
Respondent has undisclosed income.  In Issue One, above, I rejected this claim.
[106]      
In determining whether an award of retroactive
spousal support is owing, I rely on the Supreme Court of Canada’s framework in DBS
et al, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, 2006 SCC 37.  While that case specifically
dealt with retroactive child support, its analysis has been applied to retroactive
spousal support.  In determining whether retroactive support is warranted, a
court must consider:
[107]      
Ms. Logullo first sought increased spousal
support in 2023, in response to Mr. Mancuso’s motion to change.  She claims she
did not do so earlier, because he had not disclosed his income.  I am persuaded
that Mr. Mancuso was sending his income information every year to the
coordinates he had on file for Ms. Logullo. I am further persuaded that Ms.
Logullo was not comfortable receiving mail from Mr. Mancuso at her home.  At
one point, she directed that Mr. Mancuso use a post office box.  It is
plausible that his mail did not reach her even though he was following her
instructions.
[108]      
At the time of the Final Order, Ms. Logullo’s
income was set at $20,000.  Under that order, if her income increased by
$5,000, that would be a material change under which either party could seek a
change to spousal support.
[109]      
Ms. Logullo’s income improved significantly
after the Final Order.  To be sure, some of this was as a result of her spousal
support payments.  But some of it was due to a better employment situation.
[110]      
As noted earlier in these reasons, I find that
both parties were at fault for their lack of communication.  While I do not believe
that Ms. Logullo intentionally hid her financial situation from Mr. Mancuso, I
find that she did not want to communicate with him.  Under cross-examination
she acknowledged that the parties had not communicated between April 2018 and
October 2021, because Mr. Mancuso “was not the easiest person to deal with.”
[111]      
I find that Ms. Logullo’s financial
circumstances improved somewhat over the years.  She purchased a home for over
1 million dollars.  She lives with her son, who works and is able to contribute
at least somewhat to household expenses.
[112]      
I do not find that a retroactive order would
work a particular hardship on Mr. Mancuso.
[113]      
However, having regard to all of the
circumstances, including both parties’ blame for their strained communications,
I find that a retroactive spousal support award is not appropriate in this
case.
[114]      
At the end of the trial, the parties agreed that
spousal support shall terminate on January 1, 2031.
[115]      
Given that I have already declined to impute
income to either party, spousal support shall be based on their incomes as
noted in their Notices of Assessment.  For 2023, those amounts are $167,939 for
the Applicant and (excluding her spousal support) $88,450 for Ms. Logullo.
[116]      
The Final Order prescribes a formula of SSAG
mid-range spousal support plus 75% of the difference between SSAG mid-range and
SSAG high-range.  The parties could not speak to the intention behind this
formula.  It could have been prompted by concern about income disparity, the
Applicant’s nominal income, or something else.  As neither party made
submissions about this, I have no basis to depart from the formula.  Therefore,
for 2023, spousal support is $2618 ($2715 + (.75 x $2715-2327)).
[117]      
Ms. Logullo wishes to have spousal support
calculated on an assumed income for her of $45000 for 2024.  However, she does
not yet have a Notice of Assessment for 2024.  Neither, for that matter, does
Mr. Mancuso. I decline to set spousal support in advance. The parties will have
to exchange Notices of Assessment every year and adjust spousal support
accordingly.  For clarity, should Ms. Logullo’s income decrease to $45,000,
based on Mr. Mancuso’s 2023 income, monthly support would be $4,466.
