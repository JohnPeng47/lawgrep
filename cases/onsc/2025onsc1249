[1]              
The parties married on October 30, 2003 and
separated on December 25, 2021 following an 18-year marriage.  They have three
(3) children of the marriage, being A.(born July 14, 2002), B. (born December
26, 2008), and O. (born May 25, 2010).
[2]              
The key issues for this trial relate to equalization
and post-separation adjustments.[1] 
In addition, the applicant claims child support and s.7 expenses, and the
respondent claims spousal support.  The parties were the only witnesses at
trial.
[3]              
Upon marriage breakdown, the spouse whose net
family property is the lesser of the two net family properties is entitled to
one-half the difference between them: ss. 5(1) of the Family Law Act,
RSO 1990, c. F.3 (the “FLA”). This is colloquially known as an “equalization payment.”
[4]              
An equalization payment recognizes that
childcare, household, and financial management are joint responsibilities of
spouses and inherent in the marital relationship is equal contribution, whether
financial or otherwise, by the spouses in assuming these responsibilities that entitles
each to the equalization of
net family property, subject to equitable considerations under ss. 5(6) of the FLA:
ss.5(7) of the FLA; Alexander v.
Genseberger, 2023 ONSC 904 at para 44. 
The purpose of the equalization provisions is to address the unjust enrichment
that would otherwise arise upon marriage breakdown: Martin v. Sansome, 2014
ONCA 14 at para 63.
[5]              
The equitable considerations for varying an equalization payment are set
out in ss. 5(6) of the FLA that provides as follows:
[6]              
In the vast majority of cases, any unjust
enrichment that arises as the result of a marriage will be fully addressed
through the operation of the FLA equalization provisions: McNamee v.
McNamee, 2011 ONCA 533 at para 66.  Subsection 5(6) of the FLA sets
a “high threshold of unconscionability” that must be established for a
court to depart from the presumptive equalization of net family property as the
scheme is intended “not to alleviate every situation that may be viewed as
in some ways unfair or inequitable” but to promote predictability and
thereby discourage litigation: Ward v. Ward, 2012 ONCA 462 at para 25; Madi
v. King, 2023 ONCA 443 at para 19.
[7]              
The term “net family
property” means the value of all property, except for property that is
excluded by ss. 4(2) of the FLA, that a spouse owns on the valuation
date,[2] after
deducting, a) their debts and other liabilities on that date, and b) the value
of property, other than a matrimonial home, that the spouse owned on the date
of the marriage, after deducting the spouse’s debts and other liabilities other
than those related directly to the acquisition or significant improvement of a
matrimonial home, calculated a of the date of marriage: ss. 4(1) of the FLA.[3]
[8]              
The parties have exchanged net family property (“NFP”)
statements.[4] 
The applicant claims an equalization payment of $120,427.06.  The respondent claims
to owe an equalization payment of $60,415.86.
[9]              
The applicant’s NFP statement assigns 50% of the
value of the jointly-owned matrimonial home to each party on an appraised value
of $820,000.00 as of April 13, 2023.[5] 
The respondent’s NFP statement lists no value to the matrimonial home, but he similarly
accepts that 50% of its value should be assigned to each party on an appraised
value of $850,000.00 as of April 25, 2023.[6] 
Having considered both appraisals, I find that it is just and appropriate to
value the matrimonial home in the amount of $835,000.00 by applying the
mid-point between both appraisals.
[10]          
The applicant lists $2,000.00 in household goods
and furniture on the valuation date in her NFP statement.  As she arrived at
this figure by performing online searches of comparable used household items, I
accept that she has adequately established this amount. The respondent listed
no household goods or items in his NFP statement.
[11]          
Based on online searches of comparable vehicles,
the applicant values her 2016 Toyota RAV at $9,000.00 on the valuation date and
agrees with the respondent’s $15,000.00 value for his 2017 Toyota Highlander. 
The respondent asserts that the RAV was of comparable value to the Highlander
but gave no evidence for this position.  I find that the RAV and the Highlander
should be valued at $9,000.00 and $15,000.00, respectively.
[12]          
The applicant claims that her bank accounts amounted
to $2,279.21 on the valuation date.  However, her bank account records show
that her actual account holdings at separation amounted to $3,842.37 based on:
a) $2,601.32 held in an RBC daily banking account on December 24, 2021, b)
$456.35 held in an RBC TFSA on December 24, 2021, and c) $784.70 in a TD
chequing account on December 22, 2021.[7]
 Accordingly, I find that the applicant’s bank accounts should be valued in the
amount of $3,842.37 for equalization purposes.
[13]          
The applicant accepts the amounts in the
respondent’s NFP statement for his Tangerine, Simplii, Scotia, and iA bank
accounts totalling $24,542.93.  In addition, she seeks to add a further $180,660.00
to his overall bank account balance to account for certain downpayments that he
made on two pre-build investment condominiums located in Welland and Brantford,
respectively, by using a President’s Choice (“PC”) account that he did not
disclose despite requests for information made on November 10, 2022 and August
4, 2023.[8]
[14]          
To ensure a fair equalization,
I find that it would be just and appropriate to add $180,660.00 to the
respondent’s assets as of the valuation date.[9] As set out
in a summary of payments, he admits making a total of $119,080.00 in downpayments
for the condominiums prior to separation, and a further $61,580.00 in
downpayments for the properties after separation. He
claims that the downpayment funds came from undisclosed sale proceeds of land that
he had owned in the Town of Sagamu, Nigeria, and from undisclosed RSP’s.
[15]          
The applicant claims that the respondent owned
three (3) properties in Nigeria consisting of vacant land in the Town of Badagry,
a 3-bedroom flat in the Town of Ojokoro and a 4-bedroom home in the Town of
Sagamu.  The respondent testified that he visited Nigeria in 2002 and gave funds
to the applicant (i.e., who was then working at a Nigerian law firm) to buy
properties in Nigeria on his behalf, being a property in Badagary, a home in
the City of Lagos, and land in Sagamu.  Although she was to buy these
properties in Nigeria for him, he claims that she registered herself on title to
the properties without contributing any purchase funds and took over managing
the properties when he returned to Canada. After visiting Nigeria in 2014, he apparently
learned that she had mismanaged the properties.  This led to a significant
conflict between the parties.  He also claims that he and/or the applicant sold
the Badagry property during the marriage and used the proceeds to pay for their
living expenses. The applicant produced a deed showing that both parties jointly
acquired the Badagry property on June 13, 2006.  She also produced a deed by
which the respondent assigned the Ojokoro property to others on February 3,
2018 (i.e., before the date of separation).[10]
The respondent did not disclose any details about the Nigerian properties, or
how much they were sold for, even after the applicant requested this information.
[16]          
During his evidence in
chief, the respondent claimed that he obtained the downpayment funds for the
investment condominiums from the sale of the Sagamu property
(i.e., that purportedly generated about $80,000.00 CDN in proceeds) and some
RSP funds.  Later in cross-examination, he claimed that the downpayment funds were
drawn from an undisclosed line of credit and/or a credit card account.
[17]          
The respondent’s financial statement sworn
November 10, 2023 states that he paid only $61,580.00 in deposits for both
pre-build investments (i.e., $14,375.00 and $47,205.00 for each).[11] However, his unsworn summary
of payments indicates that he actually paid a total of $180,660.00 in
downpayments (i.e., $119,080.00 before the separation date and $61,580.00 after
separation) for both pre-build condominiums, as noted earlier.[12]
[18]          
The respondent did not produce
valuations for the condominiums and claims that they cannot be appraised as
they are under construction. He proposed in his NFP statement that both
properties be collectively valued at $119,080.00 (i.e., to reflect the
pre-separation downpayments). The applicant did not obtain valuations for the
properties, but produced records to show that the respondent entered into an
agreement on February 13, 2021 to buy a pre-build condominium in Welland for
$575,000.00, before signing a further agreement on June 1, 2021 to purchase a
second pre-build condominium in Brantford for $629,400.00.[13]
[19]          
The respondent claims to
have a high debt load with no equity in either of the investment condominiums. 
He stated in cross-examination that he will be unable to finance the payments that
will be due once the condominiums are built and ready for occupation due to his
limited means as he no longer has a second job and plans to retire due to
health issues.[14] 
He testified that he will be entitled to a return of his downpayments if he cannot
secure financing to complete the transactions. He did not produce any records
to meaningfully corroborate his evidence on this.
[20]          
I am troubled by the
respondent’s inconsistent evidence and lack of disclosure. He has been secretive
about the Nigerian properties and the investment properties in Ontario, and was
fairly vague and evasive when testifying about these properties. I find that
his conduct was deliberately intended to frustrate the applicant’s equalization
claim by causing uncertainty and confusion. His conduct left the applicant
unable to meaningfully address these aspects of her equalization claim.
[21]          
Given the very limited financial information
that the respondent has disclosed, he has clearly failed in his obligation to make
full financial disclosure: Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24 at para 33; Adler v. Deloitte Touche
Tohamtsu, 2022 ONCA 855 at para 21.
[22]          
In the circumstances, the evidentiary record for
the court to assess the net family property of the respondent is less than
ideal. Without adequate information, there is no basis on which to order an
equalization payment: Cohen v. Cohen, 2024 ONCA 114 at para 21.  During submissions,
the applicant proposed having the $180,660.00 in downpayments on the investment
condominiums treated as cash (i.e., on deposit in the PC account) that existed
at separation without attributing any value to the condominiums themselves.  By
doing so, the applicant submitted that the court could best approximate the
respondent’s assets at the valuation date to allow for a just and reasonable
equalization analysis (i.e., despite the lack of financial disclosure and
inconsistent evidence at trial).  The applicant advised that she would be content
to proceed with an equalization analysis in this fashion, despite the
conflicting and missing financial information in this litigation.
[23]          
It is quite obvious that the downpayment funds to
pay for the investment condominiums initially were not fully disclosed by the
respondent, who I accept is well aware of this fact.  In his NFP statement
dated February 1, 2024, he indicated that one condominium was worth $47,205.00
after a $14,375.00 deposit was paid, and that the other condominium was worth
$71,875.00 after a $47,205.00 deposit was paid. This purported disclosure was
incomplete and misleading. We now know from his testimony at trial, as set out
in his payment statement, that funds came from Nigeria to Canada and were used
to make a series of downpayments totalling $180,660.00 for both of the
condominiums that he never disclosed at all in his NFP or financial statements.
[24]          
The respondent later claimed that the funds came
from Tangerine and Scotia lines of credit, but I do not accept this evidence as
his NFP statement dated February 1, 2024 lists the Tangerine line of credit as
having a “nil” balance and the Scotia line of credit as “n/a”
(i.e., “not available” or not in existence).  The respondent claims that
he used a $5,000.00 draft drawn on a Scotiabank account in May 2021 to make a
payment for one of the condominiums, but the draft lacks any meaningful
information to account for the funds. Moreover, the respondent signed agreements
to purchase the condominiums on February 13, 2021 and June 1, 2021,
respectively (i.e., before the parties separated on December 25, 2021) so any
associated debts on the respondent’s lines of credit should appear on his NFP
statement but none are listed and none were disclosed.
[25]          
Taking this all into
account, I accept that the respondent had sufficient cash on deposit in a PC
bank account that he used to pay a total of $180,660.00 in downpayments for the
investment condominiums that should have been listed on his NFP statement but were
omitted. Given the significance of these payments, I find that the respondent intentionally
chose to conceal these funds to deliberately frustrate the applicant’s
equalization claim in this proceeding and disadvantage her.  This highly
improper conduct by the respondent was beyond unfair and was quite
unconscionable: Ward at para 25; Madi at para 19.
[26]          
Given the rather unique
circumstances of this case, I am persuaded to grant the applicant’s request and
treat the $180,660.00 in condominium downpayments as “cash” while giving
no value to the condominiums as of the valuation date. Despite the respondent’s
conflicting evidence and obvious non-disclosure, I am satisfied that this
approach allows for a sufficiently adequate factual basis to assess the net
family property of the respondent on the evidence led at trial and arrive a
just and fair equalization calculation: Cohen at paras 22 and 24. I also
find that this approach would give the applicant a just and appropriate remedy for
the respondent’s inconsistent evidence and deliberate non-compliance with his disclosure
obligations. Disclosure is the most basic and ongoing obligation in family law:
Roberts at para 11. In my view, dealing with the equalization analysis
in this fashion would allow for a fair and effective remedy for this non-compliance:
Mullin v. Sherlock, 2018 ONCA 1063 at para 41; Roberts v. Roberts, 2015
ONCA 45 at para 12.
[27]          
I find that the family law
value of the applicant’s OMERS pension as of the valuation date is $65,328.46
based on the FSRA statement of value dated January 25, 2024.[15]  For
equalization purposes, I accept the applicant’s submission that the parties
should equally share this pension value (i.e., with a $32,664.23 distribution
per party).  The applicant produced a pay stub for the respondent’s employment
at Walmart showing that he contributes to a pension plan, and earns stock
options in the company, for which he made no disclosure nor produced any
valuations despite requests for this information.  I find that the respondent’s
non-disclosure of his pension and stock options was deliberately intended to
frustrate the applicant’s equalization claims in this proceeding and,
therefore, was unconscionable. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it
would be just and appropriate to remedy his non-disclosure of his pension by disallowing
his equalization claim in relation to the applicant’s pension. The respondent should
not be allowed to evade his disclosure obligations and litigate with impunity
to the disadvantage of the applicant and the detriment of the administration of
justice. In my view, disallowing this aspect of the respondent’s equalization
claim is a fair and effective remedy for his non-disclosure: Mullin at
para 41; Roberts at para 12.
[28]          
Both parties agree that
the respondent holds $11,356.64 in UPS shares.
[29]          
During his testimony at
trial, the respondent claimed that the applicant owed him $1,500.00 for an
unspecified loan that he gave to her during the marriage.  He did not include
this loan in his NFP statement, and gave only limited details for the loan that
is undocumented. The applicant denies owing any such loan. In the
circumstances, I find that the respondent has not established this claim and I
decline to account for this alleged loan in the equalization analysis.
[30]          
The applicant is claiming $22,574.93 in student
loans as part of her debts and liabilities for equalization.  She filed a
student loan statement indicating that this principal amount was owing as of
September 1, 2021 with $217.08 in monthly payments due on September 30, 2021
and on each month’s end thereafter.[16]
Based on this, I shall adjust the applicant’s student loan claim to $21,923.69 (i.e.,
$22,574.93 less [$217.08 x 3 months]) to reflect the debt balance owing as of
the valuation date. I find that the applicant’s other credit card debts as of
the valuation date are sufficiently established.[17]  The applicant accepts
the respondent’s debts on valuation date as set out in his latest NFP statement.
[31]          
The applicant is claiming a car loan of $15,000.00 as a debt on
the valuation date.  However, her car loan records show a car loan balance of
$3,801.16 as of December 2023 with a bi-weekly payment of $178.33.[18] 
Applying a monthly payment of $356.66 (i.e., $178.33 x 2) over a 24-month
period (i.e., retroactively to January 1, 2022), I find that the applicant’s
car loan at the time of separation amounted to $12,361.00 (i.e., $356.66 x 24
months + $3,801.16).
[32]          
The following summarizes the equalization analysis:
[33]          
Accordingly, I find that the respondent should
pay the applicant an equalization payment in the amount of $116,471.89.
[34]          
There are post-separation adjustments to be
accounted for since the date of separation.
[35]          
From January 1, 2022, the respondent stopped
paying the mortgage and carrying costs for the matrimonial home, leaving the applicant
paying all these costs without any contributions from him.[20]  The mortgage payments were
$2,979.86 per month (i.e., based on bi-weekly payments of $1,489.93).[21] Property taxes came to
$4,751.29 per year.[22] 
The applicant filed a 2022 property insurance invoice for $1,277.64 per year and
testified that the insurer later lowered the premiums to about $1,000.00 per
year.[23] 
I accept that the gas bill for the matrimonial home was $188.63 per month, the
water heater rental was $40.63 per month, the water bill was $60.23 per month
(i.e., based on a $180.69 invoice sent every 3 months), the hydro bill was
$101.00 per month, and the internet bill was $92.54 per month.[24]  As a result, I find
that the respondent should reimburse the applicant for 50% of these payments
made from January 1, 2022 to February 28, 2025 as follows:[25]
[36]          
Based on all of this, I find that the respondent
should pay the applicant post-separation adjustments totalling $51,386.95
(i.e., $38,738.18 + $5,147.23 + $1,222.15 + $2,452.19 + $528.19 + $782.99 +
$1,313.00 + $1,203.02).
[37]          
I find that the respondent owes child support.
[38]          
The purpose and promise
of child support is to protect the
financial entitlements due to a child by their parents: Michel v.
Graydon, 2020 SCC 24 at para 38.  Child support is
the right of the child: D.B.S. v. S.R.G., 2006 SCC 37 at para
38.  The right to child support survives
the marriage breakdown of the parents of the child and should, as much as
possible, give the child the same standard of living they had when the parents
were together: D.B.S. at
para 38.  The specific amount of child support owed
will vary depending on the income of the payor parent: Ibid
[39]          
The court’s
jurisdiction to order child support is found at ss. 5.1(1)
of the Divorce Act,  RSC 1985, c.3 (2d Supp).  A child over the
age of majority is entitled to child support if found to remain under the
charge of a parent and unable to withdraw from the parent’s charge or to obtain
the necessaries of life: ss.2(1) of the Divorce Act.  The amount
of a child support order for children
under the age of majority is set out in applicable tables based on the number
of children to whom the order relates and the income of the spouse against whom
the order is made: ss. 3(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175
(the “Guidelines”).  A spouse’s income for child support purposes is determined by using the
sources of income under the “Total income” heading in the CRA T1 General
form, as adjusted by Schedule III: s. 16 of the Guidelines. 
Should the court find that considering a spouse’s annual income under s.16 would not be the fairest determination of
that income, it may consider the spouse’s income over the last three years and
determine an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of
income, fluctuation in income, or receipt of a non-recurring amount over those
years: ss. 17(1) of the Guidelines. An adult child who is
pursuing educational studies, taking a brief hiatus from those studies, or in a
modest transition period after completing an education program may be a
dependent child who is entitled to child support: Pennington
v. Pennington, 2021 ONSC 7371 at para 24.
[40]          
The parties separated on December 25, 2021 after the respondent
confronted the eldest child, A., who was home from university for the holidays. 
This led to an altercation between the parties.  After police were called, the respondent
left the matrimonial home where the applicant and the children continue to
reside.  The applicant is claiming child support as of January 1, 2022 for the three
children of the marriage.
[41]          
At
the time of separation, A. was living away from home while attending university
on a full-time basis.  Starting in December 2021, A. went for counselling services
through the university for health issues (i.e., anxiety, low mood, and a
history of trauma) that regrettably impacted her studies, relationships and daily
activities. Subsequently, by correspondence dated May 24, 2023, the university placed
A. on suspension from further studies due to academic performance. The
suspension is for a minimum period of one academic calendar year (i.e., from
the end of the 2022 Fall/Winter semester).  To date, A. has not returned to
university.  In the circumstances, I find that child support for A. should
terminate as of June 30, 2023, subject to potentially resuming in the future if
she resumes her post-secondary education.
[42]          
In determining child support, I find that it is
fair and reasonable to apply $114,674.00 in income to the respondent for 2022 based
on his notice of assessment that year.[26]
[43]          
Starting January 1, 2023, I find that the
respondent’s income for child support should be reduced to reflect only his
employment income at Walmart. During 2022, he worked at a Walmart distribution
centre and at a Legacy logistics facility. He testified that he previously worked
the second job at Legacy as a forklift operator from 2016 until August or
September 2022, but claims to no longer be able to work two jobs due to the
onset of high blood pressure and diabetes. He is currently 64 years of age. His
claims to now work only at Walmart where he earns $25.45 per hour.  He did not
produce a record of employment for his Legacy job nor lead medical evidence of any
health-related issues, as the applicant has noted. That said, and after taking
everything into account, I find that the respondent’s income for child support
purposes should be $47,718.75 per year to reflect his employment income at
Walmart (i.e., $25.45 per hour x 7.5 hours daily x 5 days per week x 50 weeks
per year) as of January 1, 2023, and I decline to impute any further income in determining
his child support obligations. Applying both annual incomes, table child
support for 2022 on $114,674.00 of annual income comes to $2,150.51 per month
for three (3) children and $1,651.36 per month for two (2) children, and table
child support thereafter on $47,718.75 of annual income is $934.38 per month
for three (3) children and $720.36 per month for two (2) children.
[44]          
Both parties accept that the respondent has paid
temporary without prejudice child support of $800.00 per month from November
2022 to June 2023, and then in the amount of $656.00 per month until now.[27] Given his earlier child
support payments, and after appropriate offsets for these payments, I find that
the respondent should pay a further $18,299.60 (i.e., $16,206.12 + $1,192.44 +
$772.32 + $128.72) in child support for the period from January 1, 2022 to
February 28, 2025 based on the following calculations:
[45]          
Starting March 1, 2025, I find that the
respondent should pay child support for B. and O. in the amount of $720.36 per
month based on $47,718.75 of income per year until either child is no longer a
dependent child of the marriage, at which point support may be adjusted.
[46]          
For the purpose of allocating the children’s s.7
expenses, I find that it is fair and reasonable to apply $86,212.00 in annual income
to the applicant based on her notice of assessment for 2023.[28]  The respondent alleges that
the applicant earned undisclosed income by selling food or clothing to buyers
in Nigeria, and by renting the matrimonial home through Airbnb, but he led no
meaningful evidence to support these allegations that the applicant flatly denies.[29]  On balance, I find that
the respondent has not established a basis for imputing further income to the applicant
beyond the amount in her notice of assessment. Applying the applicant’s $86,212.00
income figure to my earlier finding that the respondent currently earns
$47,718.75 in annual income, I find that the parties should share s.7 expenses
in a 64:36 ratio.
[47]          
Based on the evidence at trial of the children’s
post-separation expenses, I accept that the applicant paid $250.00 for her
son’s soccer club membership.[30] 
Although she testified that she paid $500.00 each for her son and daughter to
play soccer, she provided no receipts to corroborate this $1,000.00 claim that
I shall decline to grant.  I find that she paid $70.00 for taekwondo lessons
for a child.[31] 
I find that she paid $223.12 and $143.46 for school uniforms.[32]  In addition, I find
that she paid a total of $671.65 in various school activity fees for the younger
children.[33]
 I decline to grant her claim for A.’s rent at university given the limited
evidence to show the monthly rent amount and the lack of payment evidence.[34]  Similarly, I decline to
grant her $200.00 claim for the cost of supervised exchanges at Headwaters
Family Visit Centre due to the lack of invoices and payment evidence. Based on
a total of $1,358.23 (i.e., $250.00 + $70.00 + $223.12 + $143.46 + $671.65) in
s.7 expenses, I find that the respondent should pay the applicant $488.96 for
his 36% share of these expenses.
[48]          
For the reasons that follow, I do not find that
the respondent has a compensatory or non-compensatory entitlement to spousal
support.
[49]          
An entitlement to spousal
support must be established before the court is to consider the quantum and
duration of any spousal support award to be paid: Bracklow v. Bracklow,  1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 420 at para 49.  There are
three (3) discrete bases for awarding spousal support: contractual,
compensatory and non-compensatory: Bracklow at
para 37. A contractual basis does not arise in this case as the parties
had no agreement to pay spousal support. An entitlement to spousal
support may arise in this case on compensatory and non-compensatory grounds,
should this be supported by the evidence.
[50]          
In deciding a party’s entitlement to spousal
support, the court is to consider the following objectives of spousal support,
with no particular objective being paramount:
[51]          
An entitlement to spousal
support is made out where any of the ss. 15.2(6) objectives
are established: Bracklow at
para 49.
[52]          
In making an order for spousal support, the
Court is to take into consideration the condition, means, needs and other circumstances
of each spouse, including:
[53]          
Given that marriage is a
socio-economic partnership, an order for spousal support should compensate for
losses that the marriage or its breakdown caused that would not have been
suffered otherwise: Bracklow at
paras 41 and 49.  Compensatory spousal support addresses a recipient’s
economic loss or disadvantage from the roles adopted during the marriage, or situations
where the recipient confers an economic benefit on the payor without adequate
compensation. Common compensatory markers include being home with children
full-time, having primary care of children after separation, and moving forward
the payor spouse’s career: Rogerson and Thompson, Spousal Support
Advisory Guidelines: Revised User’s Guide (Ottawa: Department of
Justice Canada, 2016) (“SSAG”) at pp. 5-6.  Even if compensatory loss
is not established, a marital breakup may cause economic hardship in a larger
non-compensatory sense to implicate non-compensatory support: Bracklow at para 41, citing C.J.
Rogerson, “Spousal Support After Moge” (1996-97), 14 CFLQ 281
at 371-72. This “mutual obligation” view of marriage implicates
policy values:
[54]          
The court must look at all relevant factors in
light of the objectives of spousal support and arrive at a finding that
equitably alleviates the adverse consequences of the breakdown of the parties’
marriage: Bracklow at
para 36.
[55]          
I am not persuaded that the respondent has
established a compensatory basis for his spousal support claim.  He claims that
he took time off work and changed his schedule to care for the children (i.e.,
by picking them up from school and preparing food for them) while the applicant
attended nursing school and later worked as a nurse. The applicant claims that
the respondent did not cook or prepare food for the children, let alone care
for them, as it was actually the maternal grandparents and aunts who took turns
looking after the children to support her. Early in the relationship before
marriage, the applicant worked as a lawyer in Nigeria while the maternal family
supported her and the parties’ eldest daughter. During the marriage, the
applicant had the parties’ second child about nine months after joining the
respondent in Canada.  Finding herself unable to obtain legal work in Canada,
she chose to re-start her career by becoming a nurse. While she attended nursing
school in Canada, the parties’ two younger children were sent to live for two
years in Nigeria where she visited them during her summer breaks. As a nursing student,
she also worked a part-time job to support the family and contributed her OSAP
and child tax benefit funds to help pay for the family’s living expenses. In
addition, she gave evidence that the respondent did not reside with her and the
children from September 2014 to June 2015 after he was charged with assault and
was subject to no-contact release conditions.
[56]          
Taking this all into account, I do not find that
the respondent has shown that he was disadvantaged, economically or
professionally, by marrying the applicant who was the children’s primary
caregiver throughout the parties’ relationship.  On balance, I do not find that
the applicant realized any career advantages or financial benefits from the
marriage, including the respondent’s efforts to care for the children, over the
course of the relationship.  Over their 18-year marriage, I find that the
parties largely took on more-traditional family roles by which the respondent
father primarily worked outside of the home as a labourer, albeit while
performing some child care duties, while the applicant mother handled much if
not most of the childcare and household duties with support from members of the
maternal family as she pursued her career in nursing.
[57]          
In my view, neither party bettered themselves
more than the other during the course of the marriage.  Both worked hard, were
industrious, and achieved success over time.
[58]          
I am not satisfied that the respondent has established
a non-compensatory basis for his spousal support claim. Although the respondent
is no longer working a second job, I am not persuaded that he is unable to
achieve post-marital self sufficiency or otherwise support himself on his
current full-time employment income approaching $47,718.75 per year.  I am
particularly troubled by his non-disclosure and apparent decision to not
produce any meaningful information on his finances despite the applicant’s
multiple requests for information and disclosure. His non-disclosure is
conspicuous given his decision to purchase two pre-build investment condominiums
without disclosing any meaningful particulars of these purchases, without
clearly describing how he afforded to make downpayments on the properties, and
without explaining how he plans to finance these investment properties in the
future. His non-disclosure of the bank account that he used to make the
downpayments on the pre-build investment properties is telling and shows that
he deliberately tried to conceal the true nature of his financial affairs,
including his income, assets, and available credit, in a calculated effort to
hide or shield his finances to frustrate the applicant’s financial claims in
this proceeding.  In any event, the respondent has testified that he will be
able to recover the $180,660.00 in downpayments that he made on the investment
properties as he will likely be unable to obtain financing to close these
transactions. Based on his own evidence, it follows that he will soon be accessing
$180,660.00 in cash. In addition, I accept that the investment properties may
well generate not insubstantial rental income should he manage to secure
financing to close his purchase transactions for the properties.
[59]          
The respondent testified about his impending plans
to retire from the workforce.  But given his troubling lack of disclosure in
this proceeding, I do not accept that he has established a needs-based entitlement
to spousal support on the limited evidentiary record currently before the
court.
[60]          
Accordingly, I find that the respondent’s claim
for spousal support should be dismissed.
[61]          
Based on all of the foregoing, I make the
following orders:
[62]          
If the parties are unable resolve the issue of
costs, the applicant may deliver written costs submissions of up to 5 pages
(excluding any costs outline or offer(s) to settle) within 15 days, and the respondent
may deliver responding submissions on the same terms within a further 15 days. 
Reply submissions shall not be delivered without leave.
